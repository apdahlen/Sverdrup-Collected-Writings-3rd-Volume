STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "nyttige" vs. "sande" — utilitarian vs. truth-oriented education; not merely practical vs. theoretical.
* "Livsstilling" — calling or station in life, not just a job.
* "haandværksmæssig Maade" — mechanical, craft-like training, implying rote imitation.
* "Aand" — spirit/mind; must retain metaphysical weight.
* "Sandhedens Erkjendelse" — knowledge/acknowledgment of truth with biblical resonance.
* "Folkets Liv" — the life of the people/nation, civic and moral sphere.
* "Stængsler og Gjærder" — barriers/fences; metaphorical constraints.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long periodic sentences with parallel clauses and contrasts.
* Rhetorical questions that must not be flattened.
* Semicolon-like logic carried by commas.

Theological Hazards:

* Concepts of truth, freedom, awakening of spirit and heart.
* The moral purpose of education tied to truth’s victory.

Voice Hazards:

* Sermonic exhortation and polemical contrast.
* Irony (“Tænk aldrig!”) that must remain sharp.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Tænk aldrig!" — ironic maxim; should sound like a commandment of false pedagogy.
* "gjøre sin Lykke i Livet" — make one’s fortune; success in worldly terms.
* "oversvømmes med en Flom af Ord" — deluged with words; biblical flood imagery.
* "alt sluges, men lidet eller intet fordøies" — digestion metaphor common in pietistic pedagogy.
* "Afsdal" — narrow, shaded valley; image of limited horizon.
* KJV parallels: light vs. narrowness; seeing afar off.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Rejection of utilitarian, thoughtless schooling.
* Rejection of passive, lecture-heavy schooling.
* Positive vision: formation of free, manly, independent personalities.
* Defense of language study as liberation, not vanity.
* Concluding metaphor of spatial freedom vs. confinement.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Light/awakening imagery — Eph. 5:14.
* Truth making free — John 8:32.
* Seeing afar off — Heb. 11:13.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain polemical negatives (“We would not have such a school”).
* Preserve earnest exhortation toward truth’s victorious cause.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "vilde" — deliberate intention, not mild preference.
* "maa" — necessity (rendered as must).

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Sandhed — Truth
* Aand — Spirit
* Hjerte — Heart
* Fri — Free

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Digestion, fences, valley vs. open heights retained literally.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Satirical critique vs. elevated idealism.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Maintain long sentences with measured rhythm suitable for proclamation.

STEP 11: FINAL TRANSLATION

There are schools that think more of what is useful than of what is true, where youth from the very first hour are trained for a station in life in a merely mechanical, handicraft fashion; where the first and highest rule is this: Think never! But learn to do according to this or that rule, and you will make your fortune in life. Such was not our intention with the school.

There are schools where the teachers are eloquent and the pupils mute; where the teachers are interesting, but the pupils tedious; where the pupils are daily flooded with a deluge of words, whether they gape from drowsiness or from astonishment; where everything is communicated, but little or nothing received; where everything is swallowed, but little or nothing digested. We would not have such a school.

The purpose of Augsburg was to cultivate and promote a free and manly and independent personality. We desired, if it were possible, that everything should draw toward one goal: that there should go forth from here men whose spirit and heart were awakened and set free by the knowledge of the truth; men who had learned to think truly and to speak freely; men who possessed both the ability and the strength to step forth into the life of the people for the victorious cause of truth.

To what end, then, the many languages and the much grammar? Why this, and why that? Surely not in order that a young man should have occasion to make himself a fool when he lifted his nose on high because he was one who knew Greek or Latin. But rather to remove a little of the many barriers and fences that are set about a man by the dividing languages. A man must have a little breathing space in life, a little elbow-room, lest he too soon be met by jabbing walls. It is indeed possible to live in a narrow, shadowed valley, especially when one has never seen anything else; but tenfold happy is the young man who is able to escape up onto the wide heights and look out over them. So it is also with him whose life is fenced in within the narrow bounds of a single language. There is need of a somewhat wider space, in order to look out over the course of the world’s development and to stand independent and free in life’s struggle.
