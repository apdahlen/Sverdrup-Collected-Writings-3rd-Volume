6. Address at the Conclusion of the Chair-Year, 1884

[Source: “Folkelbladet” of 13 May 1884. The closing celebration was held on 7 May. — Ed.]

It is in a moment such as this, when the joy of youth at having advanced so far mingles with the deep seriousness awakened by the thought of what is yet to come, that the fitting hour has arrived to pause, to cast a glance backward, and, if possible, to try to see a little way forward.

For this is what makes the farewell celebration from the chair so strangely moving, so inwardly beneficial for the young: that the whole of life, with its joy and its sorrow, gathers itself into a single brief second. The memories become so vivid, so luminously alive, as though they did not belong to the far past, but gathered with smiling countenances about us, nodded toward us, and said: Here we are; we have all been with you and done our part that you have come thus far. Now we will be with you to keep festival and to rejoice that this was not in vain and passed through sorrow; it was not useless that we brought you joy.

And the dreams of the future, they too present themselves in such an hour. Half-veiled are their faces, yet they bend lovingly and gently over our head and whisper to us: Give not up; we are still here, and what was set before you was Christ as the goal; it was He we held before you in the heavy hours of your life.

And when past and future thus assemble in the glad hour of youth, it lifts around the young man’s eye a firmament of glittering, blinking stars, and he scarcely knows toward which he shall reach—whether it be into the deep spring of memories, or toward the blue star of longing.

He who has experienced such moments never forgets them; therefore it is precious to be allowed to lay down a small seed of solemn earnestness in such an hour; if it reaches the soul, then in its own time it will come again with increase and with fruit.

What lies nearest at hand for us is to speak together of what the time means which we have spent together at Augsburg. So many, and so many kinds of feelings are there, that it is only fitting to ask: what does our school will, and why does it will to be what it is? Many, many times will your thoughts go back to old Augsburg; and then we would so gladly have it be the case that there should be a strong reminder of the chair’s founding thought in your hearts.

There are many things which in the future will rise up in your remembrance and give you a wholesome, heart-moving laughter, and I would say: would that there were many such things that you might take with you; they are well granted. But it is not of these that we will speak; those things speak for themselves.

There are things which have happened to you and to us, which you will never be able to remember without melancholy and pain; neither of these will we speak of now.

There are holy moments which we have had together and each one by himself; they will knock many times upon the door of the heart; open to them when they come again, for they will bring new strength with them each time. Neither of these will we speak of now.

But of this one thing will we speak together: what has our school, in all this, sought to accomplish for you? There is one great thought running through it all. It is the thought of being a school for personal development.

It was the home with the building, it was the thought in the timetable, it was the intention of the instruction, it was the plan of the boarding club and the sick-benefit association, it was the principle in the whole governance and ordering.

There are schools whose thoughtless, spirit-drying task seems to be that of stuffing knowledge into the young, as one puts peas into an empty sack. That was not our intention.

There are schools whose conscience-less work is that of being a Procrustes-bed for the young, where all were to be made the same size and the same smallness, clipped off or stretched out until the same coat and the same uniform fitted them all. Inhuman schools, whose teachers have not understood that the coat must fit the man, not the man the coat. These are the schools of dogmatic systems, where all are to be driven to think other men’s thoughts, not their own. Such schools we will not have.

There are schools that think more of what is useful than of what is true, where youth from the very first hour are trained for a station in life in a merely mechanical, handicraft fashion; where the first and highest rule is this: Think never! But learn to do according to this or that rule, and you will make your fortune in life. Such was not our intention with the school.

There are schools where the teachers are eloquent and the pupils mute; where the teachers are interesting, but the pupils tedious; where the pupils are daily flooded with a deluge of words, whether they gape from drowsiness or from astonishment; where everything is communicated, but little or nothing received; where everything is swallowed, but little or nothing digested. We would not have such a school.

The purpose of Augsburg was to cultivate and promote a free and manly and independent personality. We desired, if it were possible, that everything should draw toward one goal: that there should go forth from here men whose spirit and heart were awakened and set free by the knowledge of the truth; men who had learned to think truly and to speak freely; men who possessed both the ability and the strength to step forth into the life of the people for the victorious cause of truth.

To what end, then, the many languages and the much grammar? Why this, and why that? Surely not in order that a young man should have occasion to make himself a fool when he lifted his nose on high because he was one who knew Greek or Latin. But rather to remove a little of the many barriers and fences that are set about a man by the dividing languages. A man must have a little breathing space in life, a little elbow-room, lest he too soon be met by jabbing walls. It is indeed possible to live in a narrow, shadowed valley, especially when one has never seen anything else; but tenfold happy is the young man who is able to escape up onto the wide heights and look out over them. So it is also with him whose life is fenced in within the narrow bounds of a single language. There is need of a somewhat wider space, in order to look out over the course of the world’s development and to stand independent and free in life’s struggle.

But it is not all that is needed for a sound and free development, that barriers and fences be torn down round about us. He who would be free—for him the chief thing is this: that his spirit be penetrated by the immovable conviction of the Truth, so that in the whirl of the world’s life, into which we are fastened, he knows both whence he comes and whither he goes, knows both the Source of life and the End of life.

Therefore it is the endeavor of our School in all things to point away from the inflaming winds of doctrine that sweep over the sea of the people, and toward the simple Truth which alone can give the heart peace and the spirit a goal. In the motley multiplicity of history to find the red thread which God’s Finger, guiding and leading, draws through the whole movement toward its end—this is the chief matter for him who would become a free man in a free people. With open brow and courageous gaze he dares to go forth into the struggle, who knows that, however it may go, there is a way for him who is driven by the Spirit of Truth. Though many sink and fall on every side, the Truth yet stands firm, unshaken; and in it there is ever new strength and new light to be found in need and in darkness.

It is the Spirit for which the matter stands; and that the Spirit should have His way and His work among us—this is that for which we have prayed, therefore is it that we have labored at Augsburg. Not by many rules and many bonds have we sought to gather and preserve the young, but we have sought to fasten our faith and our trust upon the Spirit’s power over hearts unto the victory of Truth in life. And we have not been put to shame. Despite all the faults and shortcomings of our School, despite all the outward difficulties with which we have had to contend, Augsburg has nevertheless become a spiritual home for many young hearts that longed after light and truth.

And when many a time I have asked myself with wonder what it is that binds us together so strangely, there is no other answer to be found than this: it is the power of spiritual freedom which has made Augsburg a home with light and warmth, with memories both wistful and glad.

Thus it is this that we seek to fasten in our souls as a precious, awakening, and strengthening remembrance from our schooldays: our School was a home of Spirit and of Freedom, where we learned that the simplicity and seriousness of the Truth is a man’s strength in the battle of life.

And so we fasten our gaze boldly forward. Life lies before us. It is the most astonishing, the most stirred and eventful, and the most variegated life that the history of the world has yet known. And thus our people, who have come from a remote corner of the world, shall have a part therein. It is natural enough that it should be both toil and struggle for our people to keep pace. Yet only few of the peoples who come hither have such favorable conditions for taking part. For if they have learned little at home, then they have the less to unlearn again. And if in the old world they had but little inclination to take part, then they have fresher powers and a sounder nature with which to lay hold together of the mighty life in the new world.

But few of our people in America have had the opportunity to develop their thinking and their spirit as those who have spent their youth here. And a great responsibility rests upon those who have enjoyed such advantages in this respect.

For our people, with its gifts and its life, stands in a perilous position in this land. In many ways it is helpless and groping when it comes to a foreign land with a new language, new laws, and new institutions. It therefore easily falls into the hands of unscrupulous leaders. And it is not altogether free from the charge that it has in many ways come to pass thus, that our people became bound in servitude in the land of freedom. It is almost regarded as recklessness and folly for a Norwegian man to think for himself and to speak his mind plainly without first asking anyone. In a free people and in a free church there always arises such sharp party divisions that it is exceedingly difficult to avoid falling under the judgments of the political or ecclesiastical tribunals of heresy. And for the party chieftains it becomes a chief concern to press their flocks beneath themselves into the straitjacket of their doctrines.

In such a land it is the greatest benefaction that can be done for the people, that there step forth men who ask after nothing else than what is true, and who with ruthless independence uphold the truth, though the judgments of heresy should rain down upon them never so thickly.

And if it should succeed that from Augsburg there might go forth some few such men, then the little struggling school would not have been raised in vain by earnest-thinking men among our people.
