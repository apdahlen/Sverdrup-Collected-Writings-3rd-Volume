STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Alvorets Frø" – metaphor with moral-spiritual weight; not merely "seriousness" but solemn moral earnestness.
* "billigt" – older sense meaning fitting/proper, not cheap.
* "Mindelse" – reminder with formative, moral force.
* "Vemod" – quiet sorrow, wistful melancholy, not despair.
* "Styre og Stel" – governance and daily ordering; idiomatic pairing.
* "aandstørkende" – spirit-drying, spiritually suffocating.
* "samvittighedsløse" – conscience-less; moral indictment.
* "Trøie" – garment; metaphorical norm or mold.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long periodic sentences with commas and semicolons that must not be broken into modern short clauses.
* Repeated anaphora ("Der er … Der er …") creating sermonic cadence.
* Rhetorical pivots signaled by "Men" that structure argument.

Theological Hazards:

* Language of soul, heart, remembrance, holy moments, strengthening grace.
* Educational philosophy framed as moral-spiritual formation, not utilitarian training.
* Implicit doctrine of personal calling and conscience.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest pastoral address to former students.
* Moral contrast between humane and inhumane schooling.
* Risk of flattening vivid metaphors (seed, door of the heart, Procrustes-bed).

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "at lægge ind et lidet Alvorets Frø" – sowing a seed of solemn moral seriousness; echoes biblical sowing imagery (Matt. 13).
* "naar det frem til Sjælen" – reaches the soul; spiritual penetration.
* "banke paa Hjertets Dør" – Rev. 3:20 echo; moments calling for reception.
* "Trippel og Frugt" – return multiplied and bearing fruit; Luke 8 / John 15 resonance.
* "proppe Kundskaber … som Ærter i en tom Sæk" – crude mechanical instruction.
* "Prokrustesseng" – classical allusion to forced uniformity.
* "Trøien faar rette sig efter Manden" – proverbial reversal affirming personal dignity.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Opening reflection on unforgettable formative moments.
* Justification for planting seriousness in such moments.
* Turn to shared memory of Augsburg and its emotional complexity.
* Deliberate exclusion of lighter memories, painful memories, and holy memories as topics.
* Central question posed: What did the school seek to accomplish?
* Thesis: the school exists for personal development.
* Enumeration of how this principle shaped every aspect of school life.
* Contrast with two false models of schooling: mechanical knowledge-stuffing and coercive uniformity.
* Final rejection of dogmatic, dehumanizing systems.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Seed, fruit, multiplication – Synoptic parables.
* Soul and heart imagery – pervasive biblical anthropology.
* Knocking at the door – Revelation 3:20.
* Fruit-bearing as evidence of true life and growth – John 15.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain earnest exhortation without sentimentality.
* Preserve sharp moral judgments against inhumane schooling.
* Retain pastoral warmth toward students.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* Preserve wishes ("gid") as fervent hopes, not casual desires.
* Maintain categorical negations ("Det var ikke vor Mening" / "Slige Skole vil vi ikke have").

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Sjæl – soul
* Hjerte – heart
* Styrke – strength
* Tanke – thought / guiding idea

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Seed imagery retained.
* Sack of peas metaphor retained.
* Procrustes-bed fully preserved.
* Garment/man metaphor preserved verbatim.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Gentle remembrance vs. severe critique.
* Warm hope vs. moral rejection.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Retain parallelism and rhythmic repetition.
* Preserve long sentence flow suitable for address.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

He who has experienced such moments never forgets them; therefore it is precious to be allowed to lay down a small seed of solemn earnestness in such an hour; if it reaches the soul, then in its own time it will come again with increase and with fruit.

What lies nearest at hand for us is to speak together of what the time means which we have spent together at Augsburg. So many, and so many kinds of feelings are there, that it is only fitting to ask: what does our school will, and why does it will to be what it is? Many, many times will your thoughts go back to old Augsburg; and then we would so gladly have it be the case that there should be a strong reminder of the chair’s founding thought in your hearts.

There are many things which in the future will rise up in your remembrance and give you a wholesome, heart-moving laughter, and I would say: would that there were many such things that you might take with you; they are well granted. But it is not of these that we will speak; those things speak for themselves.

There are things which have happened to you and to us, which you will never be able to remember without melancholy and pain; neither of these will we speak of now.

There are holy moments which we have had together and each one by himself; they will knock many times upon the door of the heart; open to them when they come again, for they will bring new strength with them each time. Neither of these will we speak of now.

But of this one thing will we speak together: what has our school, in all this, sought to accomplish for you? There is one great thought running through it all. It is the thought of being a school for personal development.

It was the home with the building, it was the thought in the timetable, it was the intention of the instruction, it was the plan of the boarding club and the sick-benefit association, it was the principle in the whole governance and ordering.

There are schools whose thoughtless, spirit-drying task seems to be that of stuffing knowledge into the young, as one puts peas into an empty sack. That was not our intention.

There are schools whose conscience-less work is that of being a Procrustes-bed for the young, where all were to be made the same size and the same smallness, clipped off or stretched out until the same coat and the same uniform fitted them all. Inhuman schools, whose teachers have not understood that the coat must fit the man, not the man the coat. These are the schools of dogmatic systems, where all are to be driven to think other men’s thoughts, not their own. Such schools we will not have.
