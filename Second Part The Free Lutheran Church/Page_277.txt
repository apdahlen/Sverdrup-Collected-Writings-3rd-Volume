STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Menighed" – carries ecclesiological weight (church/congregation) beyond a mere gathering.
* "Kar af Guld og Sølv … Træ og Ler" – biblical metaphor (2 Tim 2:20) requiring scriptural resonance.
* "Vanære / Ære" – honor/shame language with moral-theological force.
* "Tilsyndelse" – older term meaning reproof or rebuke, not accusation.
* "Udsondrende" – separating in a spiritual, not merely social, sense.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long, multi-clause sentences with sermonic rhythm.
* Semicolon logic and cumulative argumentation.
* Parenthetical explanations embedded in flow.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of mixed visible church.
* Repentance, baptism, judgment, and true faith.
* Role of John the Baptist in salvation history.
* Sending of the Spirit as constitutive of the Church.

Voice Hazards:

* Solemn, didactic Lutheran tone.
* Pastoral warning mixed with doctrinal instruction.
* Risk of modernizing into neutral academic prose.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Kar af Guld og Sølv … Træ og Ler" – allusion to 2 Timothy 2:20; KJV wording should guide rendering.
* "berede Herren et velstillet Folk" – Luke 1:17; echoes KJV cadence.
* "undfly Dommen" – biblical phraseology for escaping judgment.
* "kjødelige og verdslige Tanker" – Pauline contrast of flesh vs. spirit.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: The New Testament clearly teaches that organized congregations contain mixed spiritual states.
* Support: Apostolic writings address diverse conditions within churches.
* Implication: Exhortation and correction are necessary within the visible church.
* Historical grounding: Even the earliest congregations were mixed.
* Salvation-historical explanation: God nevertheless prepared a believing people through John and Christ.
* Climax: Christ constitutes the Church only after purification through suffering, by the gift of the Spirit.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Acts, Epistles, Revelation – general NT corpus.
* 2 Timothy 2:20 – vessels of honor and dishonor.
* Luke 1:17 – John preparing a people for the Lord.
* Gospel passion narratives – persecution, crucifixion, scattering.
* Pentecost – sending of the Spirit.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain warning and astonishment at early corruption.
* Preserve seriousness regarding judgment and repentance.
* Retain rhetorical weight without exaggeration.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "maa bruges" – must be used.
* "skulde omfatte" – was to comprise.
* Avoid weakening necessity into suggestion.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Menighed – congregation/church (consistent).
* Aand – Spirit.
* Bod – repentance.
* Dom – judgment.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Sleeping/waking, falling/holding fast.
* Small flock imagery.
* Vessels metaphor retained verbatim where possible.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Instruction → astonishment → fear → historical explanation → solemn conclusion.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Preserve long sentences and cumulative clauses.
* Avoid chopping into short modern sentences.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

On the other hand, when we read the Acts of the Apostles and the Epistles and the Revelation, we receive a full and clear light upon this matter: that the organized congregations, according to their outward boundaries, comprise “not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour.” It is likewise made plain that the New Testament contains the truth as it is applied to the most diverse spiritual conditions, and it is presupposed that such conditions are found within the organized congregations.

In other words, just as each individual Christian is never all that he ought to be, so it is also with the congregation; and exhortation, warning, reproof, consolation and encouragement, correction and instruction must be employed within the outward organization of the church, that those who sleep may awake, the wavering be kept from falling, the doubting be established in the truth, and so forth. The whole Word of God will, as a rule, find its application within the congregation; at the very least, the apostolic epistles, with their varied content and their many exhortations, were written to Christian congregations.

It almost awakens astonishment—and it ought to awaken terror—that it was thus already in the very first congregations. God had, after all, in a quite particular manner ordered everything so that the outward organization of the congregation from the beginning was to comprise believing people, and none other.

What was the work of John the Baptist but to “make ready for the Lord a people prepared,” that is, to prepare the congregation by preaching repentance and by baptism? Within the people of the old covenant there was, through the ministry of John, to take place a separation of those who truly would flee from the judgment and receive salvation. And John set as the decisive mark the baptism of repentance, with which he baptized those “who confessed their sins.” And after John had thus labored in Israel, separating and setting apart, Jesus came; and he did not establish a congregation while the people by the thousands thronged about him and would make him king. He waited until persecution and crucifixion and death had frightened away all who harbored fleshly and worldly thoughts concerning him and the kingdom. And only when the flock had become so small that it appeared altogether useless as a beginning for the kingdom—only then did Jesus make this little flock into a congregation, by sending them his Spirit.
