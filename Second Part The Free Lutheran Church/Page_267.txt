STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Menighed" (congregation/church) in its concrete local sense, not abstract denomination.
* "Ældste eller Biskoper" reflects New Testament equivalence of elders/overseers.
* "Kirkestyrelse" denotes centralized ecclesiastical governance, not pastoral care.
* "Aandsudgydelsen" refers to Pentecost, the outpouring of the Spirit.
* "Fordærvelse" implies spiritual ruin, not mere inconvenience.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long argumentative sentences with multiple negations.
* Repeated parallel denials ("ei heller om …").
* Sermonic cadence with causal and concessive clauses.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of the church (ecclesiology) grounded in the New Testament.
* Necessity vs. non-necessity in matters of salvation and Christian life.
* Distinction between divine command and human institution.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest, polemical Lutheran-free church tone.
* Appeals to conscience and Scripture.
* Warnings against spiritual danger.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Guds Rige" – the Kingdom of God, biblical and eschatological.
* "bøier sig for Guds Ord" – submits to the authority of Scripture.
* "til Fordærvelse" – unto ruin, echoing biblical language.
* "fra Aandsudgydelsen til Kristi Gjenkomst" – from Pentecost to the Second Coming.
  KJV parallels provide natural resonance for these expressions.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Denial of New Testament warrant for centralized church governance.
* Historical claim: such governance arose as a sign of decline.
* Logical argument: what never existed cannot be necessary.
* Positive assertion: the local congregation is necessary and sufficient.
* Pastoral warning regarding neglect of congregational life.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Acts and Pauline epistles on elders/bishops.
* Matthew and Luke on the Kingdom of God.
* Pentecost narrative (Acts 2).
* Eschatological reference to Christ’s return.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

Warnings and assertions are retained without softening, preserving urgency and seriousness.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "nødvendigt" rendered as "necessary" without weakening.
* Absolute claims preserved ("absolutely necessary").

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Menighed – congregation
* Guds Rige – Kingdom of God
* Kirkestyrelse – church government

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* No metaphors flattened; imagery of kingdom and body preserved.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Contrast between liberty and danger, sufficiency and neglect, preserved.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences retained where rhetorically intentional.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

We maintain that in the New Testament there is no mention of any bishopric over, or within, more than a single congregation; nor of any papacy; nor of any church department; nor of any church council or synod. There is a congregation in every place where there are Christians, and this congregation has its elders or bishops; but there is no “church government” of any kind.

It is a sign of decline and decay that, not long after the days of the apostles, one began to establish “church governments” of one sort or another over greater or smaller portions of the church, and supposed thereby to obtain a better form of the Kingdom of God. In reality there has never at any time existed any common church government over the whole Christian church. Neither does anything of the kind exist in our own day.

It therefore appears to us an unreasonable and unjust demand when it is now so often represented as though all congregations were obliged to belong to this or that outward association, in order that they might come under the proper church government. Those who do not regard a common church government as either necessary or compulsory are called anarchists. But that which did not exist in apostolic times, which has never afterward existed in the church, and which does not exist in the present time, can scarcely be necessary for Christianity. For if this were necessary, then there has hitherto never existed the right kind of Christianity.

For the Kingdom of God, according to the New Testament, it is necessary to have a congregation; but we cannot see that any other outward organization above the congregation is a necessary element of Christianity.

It is therefore a principle of the Free Church, which bows only to the Word of God and to nothing else, that the congregation is a sufficient form for the Kingdom of God, and that no other form is required from the outpouring of the Spirit until the return of Christ. Yet according to the will of God, revealed in His Word, the congregation is, in return, absolutely necessary wherever it is possible. Where a single Christian lives alone in prison or under other constraint, the lack of a congregation will not become to him unto ruin; but where Christians can be a congregation and will not, there is assuredly great danger for their souls.

As to whether councils, synods, popes, and church departments, which are not commanded in the Word of God, have done more good or more harm, we cannot judge. God knows. Here among us in America these authorities over congregations have at any rate contributed greatly to party spirit and other sin.
