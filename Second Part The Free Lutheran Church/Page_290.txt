STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "forsage" — older form meaning to lose heart / despair, not merely "give up".
* "sjæleligt" — pertains to the soul/spiritual life, not psychological.
* "Godeirstfrugterne" — rare/archaic compound; sense of prematurely forced or artificially produced fruits of zeal or enthusiasm.
* "mandigt" — courageously, steadfastly; not gendered bravado.
* "Byrde" — Pauline term with moral/spiritual weight (Gal. 6).
* "Sværmeri" — religious enthusiasm viewed pejoratively; must retain polemical edge.
* "Aands Drift" — inner compulsion/impulse of the Holy Spirit.
* "Indskrænket" — constrained or restricted, not merely limited.
* "Vantroeen" — unbelief as culpable resistance, not mere doubt.
* "fortabes" — perish in a theological, eternal sense.
* "Gjenløsningsbetaling" — ransom/redemption price (Mark 10:45 echo).

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long paratactic sentences with sermonic cadence.
* Parallel constructions that should not be broken into short modern clauses.
* Embedded scriptural quotations requiring recognizable biblical rhythm.
* Rhetorical questions driving exhortation.

Theological Hazards:

* Law of Christ (Gal. 6:2) — must retain Pauline doctrinal clarity.
* Faith and love as living, active realities.
* Mission as divine compulsion, not optional activism.
* Salvation, perdition, eternal death — no softening.
* Trinity-shaped argument: Father, Son, Spirit.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest, exhortational Lutheran tone.
* Appeals to conscience and duty.
* Defense of active faith against accusations of fanaticism.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "bære sin egen Byrde" / "bære hverandres Byrder" — Galatians 6:2,5; individual responsibility joined with communal love.
* "Kristi Lov" — Pauline shorthand for love fulfilled in Christ.
* "Troens bestandige Lod og Del" — faith’s continual portion/lot; echoes suffering motif.
* "Kristi Kjærlighed tvinger os" — 2 Corinthians 5:14 (KJV: "The love of Christ constraineth us").
* "søge og frelse det, som var fortabt" — Luke 19:10 (KJV resonance required).
* "gjøre ligesaa" — Luke 10:37 (Good Samaritan).
* "Kom og gaa med os" — Numbers 10:29 echoed in pietistic invitation language.

Literal renderings would weaken force unless aligned with KJV idiom.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Opening exhortation: do not despair when Christian life lacks visible glory.
* Warning against artificial spiritual fruitfulness.
* Call to courageous obedience and mutual burden-bearing.
* Defense against accusation of fanaticism.
* Transition to ecclesial application: Mission duty of the congregation.
* Principle stated: Christ’s love compels all true Christian action.
* Trinitarian grounding of mission:

  * Father sends the Son.
  * Son serves and redeems.
  * Spirit pours love into believers’ hearts.
* Consequence: believers cannot remain passive amid a perishing world.
* Analogy: the Good Samaritan.
* Extension from individual believer to the congregation as Christ’s body.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Galatians 6:2,5 — bearing burdens.
* 2 Corinthians 5:14 — love of Christ constrains us.
* John 3:16 — God loved and sent the Son.
* Luke 19:10 — seek and save the lost.
* Mark 10:45 — ransom for many.
* Romans 5:5 — love poured out by the Spirit.
* Luke 10:33–37 — Good Samaritan.
* Numbers 10:29 — invitation to journey together.

KJV diction should be used where possible.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* No mitigation of warnings about unbelief and eternal death.
* Maintain moral urgency and pastoral insistence.
* Preserve polemical edge against passivity and false prudence.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "maa" / "kan ikke" — must / cannot.
* Mission and action presented as necessity, not option.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Tro — faith.
* Kjærlighed — love/charity (context-sensitive, but stable).
* Frelse — salvation.
* Aand — Spirit.
* Fortabt / fortabes — lost / perish.
* Byrde — burden.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Fruit imagery retained.
* Burden-bearing imagery preserved.
* Journey/way to eternal life maintained.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Severity toward unbelief.
* Warm invitation toward the lost.
* Doctrinal firmness joined with evangelical love.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences retained where rhetorically intentional.
* Semicolon pivots preserved.
* Suitable for oral proclamation.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

FINAL TRANSLATION:

If everything does not at once pass into sheer glory and joy, then let us not lose heart at a single stroke. The prematurely forced fruits, which can appear only when everything is made merely soulish, are never truly free, for they have far too much to regulate themselves by and to take account of. Let us go forward courageously and let each bear his own burden, because it is right; and bear one another’s burdens, because in this way we fulfill the law of Christ.

And if one will call this fanaticism, then it is nothing other than what is the constant lot and portion of faith. And yet faith is an equally sure and good way, by whatever name it may be called.

The Missionary Duty of the Congregation.

“12. Every free congregation has, like every individual believer, the impulse of God’s Spirit and the right of love to do good and to labor for the salvation of souls and the awakening of spiritual life, as far as its ability and strength extend; in such free, spiritual activity it is restricted neither by parish bonds nor by the boundaries of societies.”

“The love of Christ constraineth us” is the principle that lies behind and beneath all truly Christian action.

God loved; therefore He sent the Son into the world, that He should be the Savior of the world.

The Son of God loved; therefore He came into the world to seek and to save that which was lost. Out of free and living love He became the servant of the many and gave His life as a ransom-payment for them.

And the Spirit of God is He who pours love into the hearts of believers, so that they are driven by the same mind that was in Jesus Christ Himself. They love, because they are born of God and have His life in their hearts.

He who has the true faith and the living love cannot remain still where there is a world all around that is blinded by falsehood, lost through unbelief, and dying the eternal death through its sins. He must seek to “do likewise” with the merciful Samaritan, as Jesus Christ has said. The salvation of souls lies upon the hearts of the saved, and they must strive to draw more with them upon the way to eternal life. “Come and go with us” is the invitation of the saved to all who are in need of salvation.

But what applies to the individual Christian must also apply to the congregation. Or how should the body of Christ have any other will, impulse, and longing than Christ Himself?
