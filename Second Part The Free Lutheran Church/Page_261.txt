STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Menighed", "Menig-heds Frihed og Myndighed" – carries ecclesiological weight (congregational autonomy/authority).
* "Frikirken" – Free Church in Lutheran, not generic nonconformist sense.
* "Aand" / "aandelige" – theological sense of Spirit, not mere disposition.
* "Trældom" – bondage/slavery with strong biblical resonance.
* "Herredømme" – lordship, dominion, not neutral governance.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long periodic sentences with rhetorical pivots and exclamations.
* Use of rhetorical questions and emphatic interjections ("Saa!", "Nei").
* Embedded contrasts that must remain intact.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of church freedom vs. spiritual vitality.
* Lutheran evaluation of state-church relations.
* Reference to Catholic tyranny and Luther’s critique.

Voice Hazards:

* Polemical, exhortational tone.
* Earnest warning against complacency and spiritual ignorance.
* Sermonic cadence that must not be flattened.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "fyldes og gjennemtrænges af Guds Aand" – biblical imagery of indwelling (cf. Eph. 5:18).
* "Kirkens babyloniske Fangenskab" – Luther’s work *De Captivitate Babylonica Ecclesiae*.
* "levede os ind igjen i dens Væsen" – returning into its very nature/essence.
* "Levendegjørelse" – quickening, vivification, spiritual enlivening.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

1. Thesis: Two indispensable conditions for the Free Church.
2. Assertion of their inseparability.
3. Rebuke of complacent claim that no work is needed.
4. Rhetorical refutation via Catholic example.
5. Historical-theological clarification of Lutheran position.
6. Transition to constitutional regulations.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Indwelling of the Spirit (NT Pauline theology).
* Babylonian Captivity (Rev. 17–18; Luther’s usage).
* Bondage vs. freedom (Galatians).

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

Warnings and rebukes are preserved with full sharpness. Exclamations and rhetorical questions retained.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "skal", "kan ikke", "maa" rendered with full necessity ("must", "cannot").

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Menighed = congregation
* Aand = Spirit
* Frihed = freedom
* Trældom = bondage

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

Images of bondage, captivity, filling, and penetration preserved.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

Severity in polemic; sobriety in regulation sections.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

Long sentences and clause rhythm retained.

STEP 11: FINAL TRANSLATION

Two things are necessary in the Free Church: 1) that the freedom and authority of each individual congregation be fully acknowledged and without any curtailment; and 2) that each congregation truly be filled and permeated by the Spirit of God. Everything in the Free Church depends upon these two things—that the congregations become independent and spiritual. And in truth they cannot become the one without the other.

It is therefore nothing but a childish and sorrowful spiritlessness and ignorance of godly things when one says that among us no labor is needed for the Free Church; for that, we already have, since State and Church are separated from one another.

So! Is the State the only power that can make—and has made—the Church unfree? If so, then the Roman Catholic Church is an excellent Free Church. Surely it cannot be the intention to lead us back again into its very nature? Or was it not precisely the Catholic bondage that Luther designated by the name: “The Babylonian Captivity of the Church”? No, the truth is this: the Lutherans preferred the dominion of the State over the Church to the harsh tyranny of the Catholic Church, and desired the protection of the State against this.

8. The officers of the Free Church shall be a Chairman and a Secretary. They are elected by the Annual Meeting for a term of one year. The Chairman serves as moderator of the Annual Meeting; the Secretary keeps the minutes of the Annual Meeting. Together these two officers publish the Annual Report of the Free Church and determine the time and place of the Annual Meeting, if the immediately preceding Annual Meeting has not determined this, and they see to it that the Annual Meeting is announced at least two months before it is held.

9. Each year the Annual Meeting elects an Ordinator, who shall assist the congregations in ordaining theological candidates whom they have duly called as pastors; likewise it elects each year a Committee for Home Mission and a Committee for Foreign Mission, and a Free Church Organization Committee.

10. The Chairman, Secretary, Ordinator, and Chairmen of standing committees may not be re-elected for more than two consecutive terms of office.

11. In addition to the regular Annual Meeting, local Free Church meetings shall be held during the course of each year in the month of June in the various congregations that may invite thereto. At each of these meetings, if possible, one or more of the Free Church’s officers or delegates shall be present; and particular emphasis shall be laid upon conversations and deliberations of an edifying nature, directed toward shedding clear light upon the work of resolving the Free Church’s tasks, and above all toward the quickening of congregational life among us.

12. These rules may be altered in such a way that proposals for alteration are presented at one Annual Meeting and voted upon at the next Annual Meeting; their adoption requires a two‑thirds majority of the votes cast.
