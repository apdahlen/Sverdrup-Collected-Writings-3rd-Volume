* Samvirke / Samarbeide – cooperative labor with ecclesial overtones.
* Redelighed – moral integrity, honesty before God.
* Forjættelser – biblical term: divine promises.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long sentences with causal and concessive clauses.
* Sermonic parallelism and rhetorical contrasts (freedom vs coercion).
* Conditional constructions that must retain force.

Theological Hazards:

* Church unity vs enforced uniformity.
* Freedom of conscience before God.
* Brotherhood as spiritual, not merely social.
* Divine promises tied to self-denial and service.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest, admonitory tone.
* Appeals to conscience and responsibility before God.
* Warning against false understandings of freedom and love.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "frihedselskende Folk" – culturally charged, moral-political self-understanding.
* "Ansvar for Gud" – accountability before God (cf. Rom. 14:12).

* Suitable for proclamation.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

For my part, it is at least clear that a dominion exercised by a church‑political majority over the congregations dissolves the fellowship of the congregations instead of gathering it. Coercion and tyranny must necessarily abolish the unity of the Church, however much they themselves lay claim to promoting it.

Free cooperation without compulsion constitutes the proper ecclesial and Christian condition. Undoubtedly it is also that which leads to the most blessed results. The so‑called associations which have practiced forced cooperation have, at least hitherto, achieved nothing but divisions, because they have sought to drive by power and majority what was appointed to be free.

If, therefore, among our freedom‑loving people and among believing men and women who bear responsibility before God, a true ecclesial life and brotherly cooperation are to come into being, then we must depart from the worldly and political tracks into which the associations have led us.

It will take a long time to come out of them; I know that well. And there is something to be thankful for in being told so—that it cannot be otherwise in the Free Church than elsewhere. Well then, what can one reasonably expect? We shall have to try to grow in age and in wisdom.

Free cooperation is established only by the consent of all who cooperate. Each congregation and each individual within the congregation is asked whether they will take part. This costs a great deal of labor, which forced cooperation seems to avoid. Yet it is undertaken nonetheless, because there is interest and spirit behind it. Therefore it also costs less money.

The short time in which we have practiced free and brotherly cooperation has at least shown that, with all the difficulties which the coercive associations have so diligently enumerated for us, it has nevertheless gone forward. And our conviction is this: if we but practice freedom and love in full earnestness and with complete integrity, then our cooperation will not be poor because it is free.

But if by freedom we mean only to be free from labor, and by love that we are unwilling to share any pain or toil with anyone, but merely wish to enjoy the pleasant company of others and the benefits belonging to others, then it is self‑evident that we are fit for nothing. Let us practice freedom and love, and voluntary cooperation shall display results that correspond to the divine promises which rest upon His free servants and upon His self‑sacrificing and self‑denying children.
