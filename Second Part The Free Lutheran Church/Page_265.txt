STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* „Menighed“ carries ecclesiological weight: congregation as spiritual body, not merely assembly.
* „Guds Rige“ evokes biblical kingdom language; must retain theological resonance.
* „Frikirke“ denotes a Lutheran free church distinct from the state church, not generic non-denominationalism.
* „Principer og Regler“ imply foundational norms, not mere administrative bylaws.
* „Arbeide“ in this context refers to ecclesial mission and organization.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long, flowing sentences with subordinate clauses and rhetorical pacing.
* Use of dashes and quotation framing that should be preserved.
* Sermonic cadence that resists fragmentation into short sentences.

Theological Hazards:

* Ecclesiology: the nature of the church as God’s kingdom on earth.
* Authority of Scripture (“efter Guds Ord”).
* The tension between freedom and unity among congregations.

Voice Hazards:

* Calm, reflective, yet earnest tone amid controversy.
* Avoiding polemical sharpness while retaining firmness.
* Pastoral address to a specific readership (“Frikirketfolket”).

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* “Den rette Form” — not merely correct structure, but divinely appointed form.
* “Midt under Kamp og Modstand” — idiom for ongoing struggle; should retain martial/spiritual overtones.
* “Se til høire eller venstre” — biblical idiom (cf. Deut. 5:32; Josh. 1:7) implying distraction or deviation.
* “Studser og tænker sig om” — conveys pause and cautious reflection, not skepticism alone.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Opening thesis: the congregation as the true form of God’s kingdom on earth.
* Authorial justification for writing: invitation and opportunity via the newspaper.
* Pastoral reassurance: maturity has been reached to allow self-examination amid conflict.
* Acknowledgment of novelty and difficulty of a Lutheran free church.
* Defense of the committee’s task and intentions.
* Conclusion: Scripture alone shows the way forward.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* “Guds Rige paa Jorden” — Kingdom of God language (Gospels).
* “Guds Ord Vei” — Scripture as guiding path (Ps. 119:105).
* “Ikke se til høire eller venstre” — Deuteronomic/Joshua echo.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain sober confidence rather than triumphalism.
* Preserve the sense of conscientious responsibility.
* Retain ecclesial seriousness without polemical excess.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* “Kun dette Spørgsmaalet” — exclusivity and necessity must remain firm.
* “Ingen anden” — absolute negation, not softened.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Menighed = congregation
* Guds Rige = Kingdom of God
* Guds Ord = Word of God
* Frikirke = Free Church (capitalized)

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* “Vei” as metaphor for doctrinal and practical direction.
* “Kamp og Modstand” as spiritual and ecclesial struggle.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Contrast between external conflict and internal calm reflection.
* Balance between humility and doctrinal resolve.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Preserve paragraph flow suitable for public reading.
* Retain measured pacing and reflective pauses.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

3. On the “Guiding Principles” of the Lutheran Free Church

—

[Written for “Folketbladet” of December 21 and 28, 1898; January 4, 11, 18, and 25; and February 8 and 15, 1899. This series of articles was later issued in a separate printing, published by a committee. The titles over the individual sections have been added by the publisher.]

The Congregation.

“1. The congregation is, according to the Word of God, the true form of the Kingdom of God upon earth.”

Since I have been invited to write something by way of illumination concerning the principles and rules of the Free Church, I am grateful for the opportunity which “Folketbladet” has kindly granted me, so that these reflections may reach as many as possible among the people of the Free Church.

It is also a happy circumstance that we have come so far that, in the midst of struggle and opposition, we can calmly consider our own work, without looking either to the right or to the left.

A Lutheran Free Church is, moreover, something so new that it is not strange if many pause and reflect.

The committee which, from the beginning, prepared the draft of rules for the work of the Free Church had a very difficult task. Yet it set to work with honest purpose. It was forbidden to it to attempt the formation of a new party, at the same time as it was charged with promoting cooperation among free congregations.

But in difficulties of this kind, the Word of God shows the way. And for us the only question is this: to find that “way out” which the New Testament points out—and no other.
