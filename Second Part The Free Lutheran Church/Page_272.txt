STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* Naademidler – technical Lutheran term (means of grace), not generic "helps"
* Naadegaver – spiritual gifts, charismatic but within Lutheran framework
* Menighed – congregation/church as spiritual body, not merely local parish
* Kald – divine calling/vocation
* Vingaarden – biblical metaphor (Matt. 20), not literal vineyard
* Pund – biblical talent/mina imagery
* Aandløs – spiritually lifeless, not merely boring

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long, periodic sentences with theological pivots
* Frequent use of "Thi" introducing doctrinal grounding
* Parallel constructions meant for oral proclamation

Theological Hazards:

* Authority of congregation vs. clericalism/state church
* Means of grace (Word, Sacraments) as sole source of true church life
* Mission, salvation of the lost, universality of the call

Voice Hazards:

* Exhortational, sermonic tone
* Polemic against state-church assumptions
* Urgent pastoral appeal

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "arbeide i Vingaarden" – biblical idiom for serving in God’s kingdom (Matt. 20)
* "hver med sit Pund" – Luke 19 / Matt. 25 imagery of entrusted gifts
* "Gaa idag hen i min Vingaard" – direct echo of Christ’s call
* "fortabte Faar" – lost sheep (Luke 15; John 10)
  KJV-style equivalents preserve resonance.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

1. Clarification of congregation’s true possession: means and gifts of grace
2. Rejection of merely formal/credential-based authority
3. Universal calling of believers to active service
4. Missionary nature of God’s love and the church’s calling
5. Promise of renewal if believers obey this call
6. Transition to need for outward organization
7. Assertion that true life comes only through Spirit via Word and Sacraments

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Vineyard laborers – Matthew 20
* Talents/mina – Matthew 25; Luke 19
* Lost sheep – Luke 15
* Body of Christ – 1 Corinthians 12
* Word and Sacraments – Great Commission; Acts 2

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

Warnings and calls to action must remain sharp and urgent. No softening of critique of spiritual deadness or false assumptions.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "er skyldig at" – moral obligation
* "kan kun" – exclusivity and necessity
* "vil der snart blive" – confident promise, not mere possibility

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Naademidler – Means of Grace
* Naadegaver – Gifts of Grace / Spiritual Gifts
* Aanden – the Spirit
* Menighed – the Congregation

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

Vineyard, body, lost sheep, instruments of love – all retained without flattening.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

Severity toward error; hope toward obedience; confidence in God’s Spirit.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

Long sentences and rhythmic clauses preserved for sermonic flow.

STEP 11: FINAL TRANSLATION

The Congregation possesses Means of Grace and Gifts of Grace, with and through which it labors. The common explanation—that the Congregation has the Means of Grace, and that it has power and authority to choose whomever it pleases, believing or unbelieving, to administer them, provided only that he “has passed his examination”—is not free-churchly, even though it accords well with our state-church customs and usages. The Congregation also has Gifts of Grace, if it is faithful to its calling. Indeed, every believer has his gift of grace and is bound to use it for the edification of the Body of Christ.

For all Means and Gifts have this one single aim, which is the same as the salvation of souls or the spread and growth of the Kingdom of God abroad and at home. We are all called to labor in the vineyard, each according to his ability and gift, each with his pound. And whatever our station in life may be, if we are in the Congregation, then this is our calling: to live for God and for His Kingdom, and to labor for it with all the zeal which God’s Spirit works and Christ’s love creates.

For if the Congregation is the people of God’s Spirit, then it is the instrument of God’s love upon earth. But God’s love is quite particularly that which seeks the lost in order to save it. For many reasons it is necessary to lay great stress upon this very point just now. For the wandering and scattered sheep are truly not far from any one of us. And this is the most important of all signs of life in the Congregation: that it wills to have all the lost saved—all those at home, all those abroad, all in the Christian lands, all heathen who do not know God. World-embracing is the calling of the Congregation, and yet the work of fulfilling it is so near at hand that it sounds to every soul: Go today into My vineyard!

If the believers in every outward congregation will begin upon this work, then there will soon be change among us; and in the midst of our spiritless age it will become manifest that even yet the Spirit of God is mighty to bring forth Congregation.

The Organization of the Congregation.

“3. According to the New Testament, the Congregation requires an outward organization, with a register of its members, the election of officers, fixed times and places for its assemblies, etc.”

The Congregation, which from the beginning is born of the Spirit, can live only by the Spirit. Therefore the Spirit’s Means—the Word and the Sacraments—are the means by which the life of the Congregation is propagated and preserved. It is only Baptism, the Word, and the Supper that can bring forth a living Congregation and sustain it, when these means are rightly used.
