STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* Menighedens Væsen – essence/nature, not merely organization
* Aandens Folk – people constituted by the Spirit, not spiritual-minded people
* Virkning – operative effect, activity
* Legeme / Brud / Tempel – Pauline and Johannine metaphors with doctrinal weight
* Husfolk – household members, covenantal belonging
* liden – small, humble, not insignificant
* let – weak, frail, not easy
* pleier – customary scholarly usage
* sterk – strong, sound, structurally firm
* fuldkommen – perfect in eschatological sense
* bie – wait with expectancy
* stancer – ceases, comes to a halt

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long cumulative sentences with semicolons and parallel clauses
* Rhetorical contrast between whole Church and local congregation
* Parenthetical biblical references embedded in argument
* Extended metaphor of building and stones

Theological Hazards:

* Ecclesiology: Church vs. congregation identity
* Doctrine of sanctification vs. perfectionism
* Eschatology: resurrection and bridal imagery
* Responsibility and accountability of the local congregation

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest, didactic Lutheran tone
* Polemical edge against bigness and complacency
* Exhortational appeals to vigilance and preparation

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* Kristi Legeme – 1 Corinthians 12; Romans 12
* Jesu Brud / Lammets Bryllup – Revelation 19, 21
* levende Tempel af levende Stene – 1 Peter 2; Ephesians 2
* Vig bag mig, Satan – Matthew 16:23 (KJV phrasing preferred)
* Kom, Herre Jesus – Revelation 22:20 (Even so, come, Lord Jesus)

Literal translation would obscure force unless KJV-aligned phrasing is used.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: The nature of the congregation is clearly defined in the New Testament
* Assertion: Congregation equals Church in essence
* Refutation: Objection that local congregations are weak
* Illustration: Building and stones metaphor
* Clarification: Believing congregation is not sinless
* Eschatological orientation: Waiting for Christ’s return
* Warning: Loss of expectancy equals spiritual death

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Body, Bride, Temple – Pauline corpus
* Peter as the rock – Matthew 16
* Resurrection of the dead – 1 Corinthians 15
* Come, Lord Jesus – Revelation 22

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

Warnings, rebukes, and exhortations are retained without softening.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* skal / maa – rendered as shall / must
* kan ikke – cannot

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Menighed – congregation
* Kirke – Church
* Aand – Spirit
* fuldkommen – perfect

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

Building, stones, bride, and body metaphors preserved intact.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

Severity in warning; hope in eschatological promise.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

Long sentences and sermonic rhythm maintained.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

Thus, according to the New Testament, there can be no doubt concerning the nature of the congregation. It is the people of the Spirit, so that it extends precisely as far as the working of the Spirit of God extends. It is the Body of Christ; it is the Bride of Jesus; it is God’s living temple of living stones; it is the household of God and His dwelling in the Spirit.

One will say: yes, that is the whole Church; it is so good, but each individual little congregation is so weak. This is not admitted. The first congregation in Jerusalem was at once the whole Christian Church and the single local congregation. In its day the one was neither greater nor more extensive than the other. And never has anything become good by becoming large. The congregation is the “little Church,” as the learned are accustomed to say. And by this is meant that everything the Church has, the congregation also has; and everything the Church is, the congregation also is. Moreover, it should be clear to all thinking persons that each individual small part of a building can more easily be good and strong and complete than the whole building; for among a hundred stones there may easily be found one bad stone, while perhaps the ninety-nine may be good stones; and while the one bad stone does not alter the ninety-nine good stones each by itself, it can nevertheless do great harm to the whole building. In any case, it is clear that the responsibility rests upon each individual congregation; it is that which first and foremost is to be God’s house and the Body of Jesus Christ.

But if the congregation consists of believing persons, is it then meant that it is perfect, that is, without sin? No, by no means. The Christian personalities are not perfect, but are to become so. Or was it not said to Peter—perhaps the very same day he was called the rock—“Get thee behind me, Satan”? There is no perfect congregation before the resurrection of the dead.

Let us wait for Him who shall come again to fetch the Bride to the marriage supper of the Lamb, and let not the Bride neglect to prepare herself. And while we wait, let this be our daily prayer: Come, Lord Jesus, come quickly! For where this expectation comes to a halt, whether because one has sunk back into the world, or because one imagines already to have attained the goal, there the congregation is no longer living.
