STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "stiftede" (appointed/ordained by God; not merely instituted)
* "Embedsmænd" (office-bearers in a churchly sense)
* "Menighed" (congregation as a spiritual body, not an organization)
* "Aand og Øndssigt" (spirit and spiritual discernment)
* "Vidnesbyrd" (moral-spiritual testimony, not legal witness)
* "Naadegaver" (charismata; grace-gifts)

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long, sermon-like sentences with theological pivots
* Scriptural quotations embedded in argument
* Parallel constructions that must be preserved

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of divine calling versus human election
* Work of the Holy Spirit in discernment
* Priesthood of all believers
* Sanctification and vocation

Voice Hazards:

* Solemn exhortational tone
* Rebuke of shallow theological speech
* Pastoral authority addressing conscience

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "tronede sin Seier" – metaphor of Christ enthroning His victory; echoes ascension theology (Eph. 4)
* "fulde af den Helligaand og Visdom" – direct echo of Acts 6:3
* "vi er ikke Hjertkjendere" – idiom critiquing false humility used to avoid spiritual discernment
* "Arbeidere i Vingaarden" – biblical image from the Gospels

KJV-style equivalents are available and should be used for Acts 6 and Eph. 4 imagery.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Correction of false assumption about church order
* Scriptural pattern: Christ gives gifts → congregation recognizes them
* Rule for proper election from Acts
* Demand placed upon congregational discernment
* Refutation of theological excuse
* Clarification of office versus universal calling
* Practical example: Christian child-rearing

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Acts 6:3 – election of the seven
* Ephesians 4:8–11 – gifts given after ascension
* Matthew 20 imagery – workers in the vineyard
* Ephesians 6:4 – nurture and admonition of the Lord

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Preserve firmness of exhortation
* Maintain critique of theological superficiality
* Retain pastoral seriousness without softening

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "maa" rendered as "must"
* "skal" rendered as "shall"
* Obligations remain obligations, not suggestions

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Menighed = congregation
* Embedsmænd = office-bearers
* Helligaand = Holy Ghost / Holy Spirit (consistent)
* Naadegaver = grace-gifts

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Vineyard imagery retained
* Enthroned victory preserved

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Doctrinal severity balanced with communal encouragement

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences preserved where rhetorically necessary
* Semicolon logic maintained

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

The relation of the matter is, according to the Word of God, wholly otherwise. According to the Scriptures it stands thus, that the Lord, when He ascended on high after His humiliation, enthroned His victory by distributing gifts among men. And these gifts caused some to be appointed unto one service in the congregation, others unto another. If then the congregation is to choose its pastors and office-bearers in a right and scriptural manner, it must seek to choose those whom God has appointed, and no others. Therefore it is written concerning one of the earliest elections—perhaps the first true congregational election: “Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom.” Here a rule is laid down for a right election; and only when the congregation understands and acknowledges this rule, and acts according to it, will its election be well-pleasing unto the Lord and profitable unto the congregation.

It is a great demand upon the spirit and spiritual discernment of the congregation, that it should know those who not only have a good report, but are also “full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom”; and this accords ill with all the theologians’ light-minded, superficial, and thoughtless use of the phrase, that “we are not knowers of hearts.” The congregation is, according to Scripture, bound to know who are “full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom,” if it is truly to be a free and self-governing congregation.

Thus then the congregation receives its rightful office-bearers, through the Lord’s grace-gifts and through the congregation’s upright election. And it may surely, without too great error, be said that the congregation’s office-bearers are in a special sense the congregation’s workers, called thereto by God and by the congregation. But thereby it is not said that these alone are to labor, and no others. All believers, great and small, young and old, men and women, shall be workers in the vineyard. For there is no sense in apprehending the matter thus, that the members of the congregation lay aside their labor upon the office-bearers. These receive their particular charge; but there remains always more than enough left over for all the others.

Take, for example, Christian child-rearing and instruction. Can the school of religion abolish parents’ duty and obligation to bring up their children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord? And so it is in all the spiritual branches of the work of the congregation. The more spiritual a matter is, the more are all believers bound to take part in it with their gifts and abilities.
