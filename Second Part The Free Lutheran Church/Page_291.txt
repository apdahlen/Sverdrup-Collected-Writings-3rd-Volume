STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Menigheden" (congregation/church as living body, not mere institution)
* "Mission" in broad 19th‑century pietistic sense
* "Indremission," "Jødemission," "Hedningemission" as technical devotional terms
* "Aand" (Spirit) with theological specificity
* "Kald" (divine calling, not occupation)
* "Gjærder" (fences/hedges as metaphor for spiritual barriers)
* "Pest" used polemically (not literal disease)

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long chained sentences with rhetorical questions
* Parallelism and sermonic cadence
* Semicolon logic that must not be flattened

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of the Church as Christ’s instrument
* Universal scope of Christ’s love
* Necessity and divine obligation of mission
* Spiritual sleep vs. awakening
* Authority of Word and Spirit over ecclesiastical structures

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest exhortational tone
* Polemical edge against complacent churchliness
* Biblical gravity and moral urgency

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "kjøbt den med sit Blod" – redemption language (Acts 20:28; 1 Pet. 1:18–19)
* "samle alle til sin store Nadver" – echo of Luke 14:16–24 (Great Supper)
* "springe over Mure" – love overcoming barriers (cf. Ps. 18:29)
* "rive dem ud af brændende Hus" – Zech. 3:2; Jude 1:23
* "sove i Ro" – spiritual complacency (Rom. 13:11)

KJV-style equivalents are appropriate throughout.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: The Church exists to manifest Christ’s life and serve as His instrument.
* Ground: Christ’s universal love and redemptive work.
* Inference: Therefore the Church must be missionary by nature.
* Expansion: Mission defined broadly and universally.
* Polemic: Love is not constrained by human or ecclesiastical barriers.
* Illustration: The Good Samaritan.
* Application: Rebuttal of false security in institutional religion.
* Conclusion: Biblical precedent in Christ, Paul, and the Jerusalem Church.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Redemption by blood – Acts 20:28
* Drawing all to Himself – John 12:32
* Great Supper – Luke 14
* Mercy of Samaritan – Luke 10:33–37
* Snatching from fire – Jude 1:23
* Christ in synagogues – Matt. 4:23
* Paul preaching everywhere – Acts

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

Warnings, rebukes, and calls to awaken sleepers are preserved without mitigation.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "kan den da" → moral impossibility
* "maa" → divine necessity
* "lige forpligtet" → binding obligation

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Menighed → Church / Congregation
* Aand → Spirit
* Mission → Mission
* Kjærlighed → Love (divine)
* Kald → Calling

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Fences, walls, burning house, sleep preserved as metaphors.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* From doctrinal exposition to sharp pastoral warning and biblical appeal.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences retained where rhetorically intentional.

STEP 11: FINAL TRANSLATION

The Congregation exists, indeed, in order to make manifest the Life of Christ and to be His instrument and servant. What else, then, can it do than perform His works—He who has purchased it with His blood and bestowed upon it His Spirit?

The love of Christ reaches unto all; He will draw all unto Himself, He will gather all to His great Supper. Men unto the uttermost ends of the earth are the objects of His love.

The Congregation therefore cannot be without mission. It must go forth and ever further. Its whole being is ordered toward the expansion of the Kingdom of God; it has come into existence through mission, and it is appointed to carry on mission. The one follows from the other.

And here mission is taken in its most general sense, embracing those who are near and those who are far off—both what is called Inner Mission and Jewish Mission and Heathen Mission. The meaning is to seek after that which is lost, wherever it is found.

The love that is from God is unlimited by all things except God and the Word of God. When, therefore, men often make use of human arrangements in order to shut out the Word and Spirit of God from themselves, then love seeks to leap over walls and to break through barriers. And whether the obstacles are called refined walls or Catholic ban-bulls or parochial bonds of the state church makes no difference to love.

Or how was it with the merciful Samaritan? Was it his “district” where the poor wayfaring man was assaulted between Jericho and Jerusalem? Was there first a question concerning boundaries? Or was not mercy free according to its eternal law and nature, so that it has compassion on whom it has compassion, without asking after anything else than need and misery?

When, therefore, the notion has spread among worldly churchfolk that one need only enter a certain society, and then one is shielded against lay preachers, awakening, and other such “pests,” then it is the calling of the Congregation to overcome such false imaginings and to break down such hedges. Nowhere do souls have the freedom or the right to sleep in peace in spiritual matters, insofar as the Congregation can do anything to awaken them and to snatch them out of the burning house. Though the spiritually sleeping have ever so carefully appointed priest and sexton to protect their sleep and make it more secure, still the Congregation is just as bound to labor for the salvation of those who sleep.

Jesus visited every synagogue into which He could gain entrance, and the Temple itself became witness to the manifestation of His mighty power despite the displeasure of His opponents. And Paul preached wherever he came, despite synagogue rulers. And the Congregation in Jerusalem wrote to all the congregations and exhorted them.
