STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "tidsmæssigt" – here meaning timely/urgent, not merely temporal.
* "paakrævet" – carries moral necessity, not convenience.
* "Menighedens Gjenreisning" – restoration/reconstitution, with ecclesiological weight.
* "Stiftelse" – foundational constitution/ordering, not mere founding.
* "Naademidler" and "Naadegaver" – means of grace and gifts of grace, doctrinally fixed Lutheran terms.
* "Salighed" – eternal blessedness/salvation, not general happiness.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long periodic sentences with rhetorical buildup.
* Conditional clauses leading to accusatory rhetorical questions.
* Sermonic cadence that should not be fragmented.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of the Church as gathered by the Spirit.
* Means of grace and communal pursuit of salvation.
* Opposition of clergy framed as resistance to God’s work.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest, confrontational, exhortational tone.
* Risk of softening critique of Lutheran clergy.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "arbeide, som gaar ud paa" – purposeful labor directed toward a defined spiritual end.
* "under man ikke Folket dette Gode" – why begrudge the people this good; moral reproach.
* Biblical idiom of fulfillment: Moses’ wish, David’s psalm, Jeremiah’s prophecy.
* Strong KJV parallels available for cited Scripture.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: Nothing is more urgent than restoring the congregation on biblical, NT foundations.
* Observation: Clerical opposition is spiritually discouraging.
* Argument: If congregation is God’s work and blessing, opposition is unjustifiable.
* Scriptural grounding: Church as fulfillment of OT prayer, song, and prophecy.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Numbers 11:29 (author cites v. 28): Moses’ wish for a prophetic people.
* Psalm 110:3 – Willing people in the day of power.
* Jeremiah 31:33–34 – New Covenant promise.
* Retain KJV diction for recognizability.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain accusatory rhetorical questions.
* Preserve solemn wonder and indignation.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "kan derfor være" → can therefore be (logical necessity).
* "maa" implications preserved as moral necessity.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Menighed = congregation/church (use consistently as congregation).
* Naademidler = means of grace.
* Naadegaver = gifts of grace.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Fulfillment imagery retained without paraphrase.
* Dew, youth, heart-writing metaphors preserved.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Contrast between divine blessing and human resistance.
* Movement from lament to exalted biblical vision.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Preserve long sentences and semicolon pivots.
* Maintain sermonic flow.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

Nothing, therefore, can be more timely and more urgently required among us than a labor directed toward the restoration of the congregation in biblical, and especially in New Testament, constitution. And nothing works more discouragingly upon a Christian mind than to see that so many Lutheran pastors oppose this cause with great zeal.

If it is good for Christian people and for the Kingdom of God upon earth that a congregation be gathered, and if it is God’s Spirit who gathers the congregation, why then does one begrudge the people this good?

In many places it is only a question whether the people will have a pastor. But when it became a matter of earnestness to ask whether one would also have a congregation, then the resistance in earnest also began from the side of many pastors. Yet if the congregation is a great and glorious divine blessing, for whose sake Christ has come and the Spirit has been poured out, why will one not that human beings should become partakers of it?

The Members of the Congregation.

“2. The congregation consists of believing people who, through the use of the means of grace and the gifts of grace according to the direction of God’s Word, seek their own salvation and eternal blessedness, and that of all their fellow human beings.”

The congregation is the fulfillment of Moses’ sigh and prayer in Numbers 11:29: “Would God that all the LORD’s people were prophets, and that the LORD would put his Spirit upon them!”

The congregation is the fulfillment of David’s song in Psalm 110:3: “Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power; in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: thou hast the dew of thy youth.”

The congregation is the fulfillment of Jeremiah’s prophecy in Jeremiah 31:33–34: “But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the LORD, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people. And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the LORD: for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the LORD: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.”
