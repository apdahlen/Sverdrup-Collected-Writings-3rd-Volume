STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* Menighed – carries ecclesiological weight beyond modern “congregation”; denotes the visible gathered church.
* Aand – Spirit; must retain biblical/theological force (Holy Spirit), not generic “spirit.”
* Sværmeri – not mere enthusiasm, but fanatical delusion in Lutheran polemic.
* Bod – repentance as lived penitential posture, not mere remorse.
* kjødelig Tryghed og Sikkerhed – fleshly or carnal security, false assurance.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long paratactic sentences with semicolon logic reflecting sermonic cadence.
* Rhetorical questions driving argument; must not be flattened.
* Accumulative clauses describing Acts 2 life of the church.

Theological Hazards:

* Visibility of the church (against purely invisible-church notions).
* Repentance, humility, baptism, Spirit-outpouring.
* Divine initiative vs. human receptivity (“Aand kan ikke paatvinges”).

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest exhortational tone addressing conscience.
* Polemical firmness against complacency.
* Pastoral urgency mingled with hope.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* “Lyden af Stormveiret” – allusion to Acts 2:2; must echo KJV phrasing.
* “Ildtunger” – Acts 2:3, tongues of fire.
* “lagdes til Menigheden” – Acts 2:41 KJV: “there were added unto them.”
* “Hold Lyset op” – metaphor of holding up a standard/light for self-examination.
* “Saalænge der er Liv, er der Haab” – proverbial, pastoral assurance.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

1. Assertion: The newborn church was visibly manifest.
2. Scriptural evidence: Acts 2 phenomena and communal life.
3. Rhetorical challenge: Was this delusion or eternal norm?
4. Thesis: This was and remains the truth.
5. Objection addressed: impossibility of reaching the pattern.
6. Rebuttal: Christ as model; call to repentance and humility.
7. Exhortation: Hold up the light; reject carnal security.
8. Conclusion: Hope grounded in God’s Spirit and human responsiveness.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Acts 2:2–4 (sound as of a rushing mighty wind; tongues of fire).
* Acts 2:41–47 (added by baptism; apostles’ doctrine; fellowship; breaking of bread; prayers).
* 1 John 2:6 (“walked as he walked”).
* Joel 2:28 / Acts 2:17 (“pour out my Spirit upon all flesh”).

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

Warnings against complacency are retained without mitigation.
The pastoral call to repentance remains urgent and solemn.
Hope is offered without sentimentality.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* “er skyldig til” rendered as moral obligation (“is bound / is under obligation”).
* “kan ikke” retained as true impossibility.
* Imperatives preserved (“Hold Lyset op”).

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Menighed – Church / congregation (capitalized when ecclesial).
* Aand – Spirit (capitalized).
* Bod – repentance.
* Omvendelse – conversion.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Light imagery retained.
* Visibility vs. invisibility preserved.
* Outpouring metaphor kept intact.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

Severity in rebuke; consolation in hope.
Sharp rhetorical questions followed by calm doctrinal assertion.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

Long sentences maintained where rhetorical flow requires.
Parallelisms preserved.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

This newborn Church was a visible company of men. Not only were the Word and the Sacraments visible; the persons who constituted the Church were themselves visible. The sound of the tempest was heard throughout the city, so that the multitude came together; the tongues of fire which sat upon each of them showed whom the Lord had filled with the Spirit; the testimony of the Lord’s mighty works was heard, and those who spoke were seen by all, both believers and unbelievers.

So far the Church is visible; and when three thousand were added to the Church by baptism, the Church was still visible. And when all that believed continued steadfastly in the apostles’ doctrine and fellowship, and in the breaking of bread, and in prayers; and when they were daily with one accord in the temple; and when they were together and had all things in common—then it was a visible Church of believing men.

Was all this, then, a delusion throughout, a fanaticism without meaning and without significance for the future? Was it a misunderstanding which history was destined to correct? Or was it the light—the light of the Spirit and of the truth—which was to shine for souls and for Churches at all times until the return of Christ?

We hold that this was the truth, and is the truth, and shall remain the truth; and that what is called Church is bound to test itself by this light.

It is said that this is meaningless; for all know that we cannot attain to this pattern. But is not Jesus Christ our example, and are we not bound to walk even as He walked? We know indeed that we cannot attain it; but does it not therefore become us to live in the acknowledgment of sin and in humility? And for the Church it would already be an advance, if it would begin to live in repentance instead of in carnal ease and security. Hold up the light, and be assured that it will never be too bright in the Church.

But is it impossible? Is it impossible for us to repent and to believe in Jesus Christ? Let us not give up hope for the conversion of any man, or of any member of the Church. So long as there is life, there is hope. The Lord will pour out His Spirit upon all flesh; the question is whether all flesh is ready to receive the Spirit; for the Spirit cannot be forced upon anyone.
