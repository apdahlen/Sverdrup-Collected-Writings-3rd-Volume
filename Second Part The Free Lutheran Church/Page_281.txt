STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Menighed" in 19th‑century usage denotes the believing congregation, not merely an institutional parish.
* "Selvstændighed" implies spiritual and moral autonomy under God, not independence from divine authority.
* "Ansvar" carries eschatological accountability before God.
* "Naadegaver" refers to charismata / gifts of grace given by the Holy Spirit.
* "Embedet" signifies the ecclesial office, not merely a job or profession.
* "ugudelig Mening" is a strong moral–theological judgment, not a neutral disagreement.
* "uomvendt" denotes unregenerate / unconverted in a strict spiritual sense.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long, chained sentences with causal logic must be preserved.
* Repeated parallel clauses (“det er sandt … men det er ogsaa sandt …”) form a deliberate rhetorical structure.
* Negations (“ei”, “ikke”) carry doctrinal weight and must not be weakened.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of the priesthood of all believers.
* Relation between external call and internal gifting by the Spirit.
* Accountability of the congregation before God.
* Distinction between office and spiritual qualification.

Voice Hazards:

* Strong polemical and exhortational tone.
* Direct confrontation of false doctrine.
* Sermonic cadence aimed at conscience, not academic detachment.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "fuldt forvisset i sit eget Sind" – biblical idiom (cf. Romans 14:5), meaning inward spiritual conviction.
* "driver … gjennem Ordet" – pietistic expression for the Spirit’s governance through Scripture.
* "kræve den til Regnskab" – judicial/accountability language with eschatological force.
* "uden Lys og uden Kraft" – Johannine and Pauline imagery (light/power).
* "en kraftigere Fordreielse" – rhetorical superlative stressing grave doctrinal corruption.
* KJV-style equivalents naturally fit phrases like “light,” “power,” “walk the way,” “give account.”

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: The congregation possesses spiritual responsibility and accountability before God.
* Ground: God governs and enlightens the congregation through Word and Spirit.
* Polemic: Rejection of the claim that gifts now belong only to clergy by virtue of office.
* Exposure: This error defends the legitimacy of unconverted clergy.
* Doctrinal correction: True ministry requires faith and spiritual gifting, not merely external call.
* Expansion: Spiritual gifts are distributed among all believers, not clergy alone.
* Conclusion: Both clericalism and reduction of laity to financial support are rejected.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Romans 14:5 – being fully persuaded in one’s own mind.
* Psalm 119 / John 1 – light of the Word.
* Galatians 5 – walking by the Spirit.
* 1 Corinthians 12 – distribution of gifts among all believers.
* Hebrews 13:17 – giving account before God.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain strong denunciation of false doctrine.
* Preserve moral seriousness and pastoral urgency.
* Avoid neutral or academic softening of rebuke.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* Preserve necessity in "kan være", "maa", "er det vanskeligt".
* Maintain absolute negations (“cannot,” “is not”).

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Menighed → congregation
* Naadegave → gift of grace / grace‑gift
* Aand → Spirit
* Embedet → the office
* Tro → faith

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Light, way, walking, work imagery retained.
* Do not paraphrase metaphors into abstractions.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Clear shift from positive doctrinal grounding to sharp polemic.
* Final paragraph broadens critique with sober correction.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Preserve long sentences with semicolons.
* Maintain rhythmic balance and parallelism suitable for proclamation.

STEP 11: FINAL TRANSLATION

It is precisely this which gives the congregation its independence and its responsibility. It acts as it acts, because it is fully persuaded in its own mind that thus it is right and proper according to the Word of God, and thus the Spirit of God drives it through the Word. Therefore it also knows that God will require of it an account for every single one of its actions.

For God has not left His believing congregation without light and without power. Over the way and work of God’s congregation the light of the Word shines clearly and mightily; and the Spirit of God grants ability and strength to walk the way and to carry out the work.

It is not seldom heard in this connection that the gifts of grace are now, in our days, so scant that one properly speaking finds them only among the clergy. And among the clergy they are said to be found, not because the Spirit of God has given them gifts of grace, but because the congregation has chosen them and set them into “the office.”

This false doctrine is widely распростран also among us, and is frequently employed in defense of the ungodly opinion that an unconverted priest is a true priest, provided only that a congregation has called him in an outwardly lawful manner. A more violent distortion of God’s truth would be difficult to find. And yet it is not rare to hear such opinions advanced and defended within the Church.

It is true that no one can be a true priest, as a priest ought to be, unless he has both true faith and the Spirit’s gift of grace for the proclamation of God’s Word; but it is also true that he does not receive the gift of grace, nor faith itself, by the fact that through the congregation’s election he receives the outward position as preacher or priest. It is also true that he is not the only one who has received a gift of grace. To all His believers the Lord has given gift and ability to labor for the cause of the kingdom of God.

Neither is it true that all priests have gift and power to preach and to rule, and that all laypeople have only gift and ability to maintain the office by paying for it.
