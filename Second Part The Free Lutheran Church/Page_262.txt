STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Statens Vold" – not mere "power" but coercive authority/compulsion of the state over the church.
* "Frikirke" – historically charged term; not simply a denomination but a church free from state control.
* "Samfund" / "Synoder" – organized ecclesial bodies with juridical power; connotation of bureaucratic domination.
* "verdsliggjorte" – secularized in a moral–spiritual sense, not merely non-religious.
* "procesgalne" – litigious, obsessed with legal process.
* "Brændebillede" – literally a scarecrow or caricature; image of a mere semblance.
* "Verdslighed" – worldliness as spiritual corruption.
* "Levengjørelse" – enlivening, quickening, revival.
* "Vækkelsesarbeide" – revival work, awakening ministry.
* "Vernepligt" – compulsory service; here metaphorical, evoking civic conscription.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long, multi-clause sentences with sermonic pacing.
* Rhetorical questions that drive argument rather than seek information.
* Parallelisms (priests/laity, men/women).
* Semicolon logic that should not be flattened.

Theological Hazards:

* "Herrens Aand" and "Frihed" – direct Pauline allusion (2 Cor. 3:17).
* Doctrine of the priesthood of all believers.
* Spiritual life vs. death imagery.
* Salvation language: saving life, souls.

Voice Hazards:

* Exhortational Lutheran tone addressing conscience.
* Polemic against rationalism and bureaucratized church life.
* Urgency amid conflict between faith and unbelief.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Kun hvor Herrens Aand er, der er Frihed" – direct scriptural citation; KJV cadence required.
* "brændebillede" – idiom for a hollow likeness; best rendered as "mere scarecrow" or "caricature."
* "almindelige Vernepligt" – civic metaphor; evokes universal conscription, here spiritual duty.
* "bevare den i Fredens Baand" – biblical idiom (Eph. 4:3), KJV phrasing natural.
* "stod udenfor" – both literal and ironic; congregations outside structures and outside the work.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: Absence of state control does not itself create a true Free Church.
* Critique: Synods and societies exercise greater domination than the state.
* Diagnosis: Worldliness and spiritual death reign in many congregations.
* Principle: True freedom exists only where the Spirit of the Lord is.
* Application: Free Church work equals revival of congregational life.
* Call: All believers are summoned into service.
* Polemic: Rejection of rationalist clergy-only model.
* Solution: Universal obligation of all believers.
* Objection anticipated: Can independent congregations cooperate?
* Resolution: Unity of the Spirit enables voluntary cooperation.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* 2 Corinthians 3:17 – "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty."
* Ephesians 4:3 – "the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace."
* General revivalist and pastoral echoes: awakening the sleeping, saving souls.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain sharp critique of secularized church structures.
* Preserve urgency of spiritual conflict.
* Retain exhortational summons to action.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "kan" / "vil" / "skal" rendered with full necessity and certainty.
* Rhetorical questions retain force, not softened.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Frikirke – Free Church
* Menighed – congregation
* Verdslighed – worldliness
* Aand – Spirit
* Vækkelse – revival / awakening

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Scarecrow/caricature image retained.
* Yoke imagery preserved.
* Civic conscription metaphor maintained.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Severity in diagnosis.
* Hope and confidence in Spirit-led unity.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences preserved where rhetorically driven.
* Parallel structures maintained for proclamation.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

Thus, because we are outside the coercive power of the State, we are not therefore a Free Church. The so‑called “societies” or “synods” in fact exercise more lordship than the State would wish to do in our own day. But even if we did not have these secularized, litigation‑mad societies set over us, we would still be nothing more than a mere scarecrow of a free congregation, so long as sheer worldliness and death are not only present, but even reign in the congregations, as they do in many places.

Only where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. Therefore the work for the Free Church is the same as the work for the enlivening of the congregations. In this work of awakening, the Lord calls upon all believers to be laborers. All believers, both priests and laypeople, both men and women, are called forth into the Lord’s service to rescue life and to save souls.

The old‑fashioned view from the very earliest days of Rationalism—that it is only the clergy who constitute the Church’s workforce and the Lord’s servants—no longer suffices in the great struggle between faith and unbelief into which we have been cast in our time. The principle that must be applied is the common conscription of all believers. Therefore the aim is first and foremost to awaken believers to see their calling, and to walk and labor accordingly, so that they may become zealous to awaken those who sleep, both within and without the congregation.

Only when the congregations are freed from the yoke of worldliness are they truly free. But if the congregations now become so independent, will they then be able to do any work together? Will it not be with the congregations of the Free Church as it has been with the so‑called “outsider” congregations, which the church bodies regarded with such suspicion and, in part, with contempt?

This will not happen, if the believers in the congregations step forward in the work. For they possess the unity of the Spirit, and they understand how to keep it in the bond of peace. The voluntary laborers will have no difficulty in uniting to labor for the cause they love. And when each works for the cause according to his ability and gift, it will be altogether different from the “outsider” congregations, which often “stood outside” because they wished to evade the work, or because the bonds of the societies were too tight.
