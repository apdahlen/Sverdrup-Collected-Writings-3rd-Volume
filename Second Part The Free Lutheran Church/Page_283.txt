STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Opbyggelsesarbeide" – not merely "edification" in a vague sense, but active spiritual upbuilding of the congregation.
* "Naadegaverne" – charismata; gifts of grace, with Pauline resonance (1 Cor. 12).
* "Menighed" / "Menighedslemmer" – congregation understood theologically, not merely organizationally.
* "Pund og Talenter" – biblical metaphors (Matt. 25), not generic abilities.
* "Stiftelse" – foundation/constitution/establishment with ecclesial weight.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long contrastive sentences with balanced clauses ("Men … Men …") must be preserved.
* Rhetorical escalation across paragraphs.
* Embedded exhortations that should not be reduced to simple statements.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of the priesthood of all believers.
* Relationship between ordained ministry and congregational responsibility.
* Gifts as divinely bestowed and divinely accountable.
* Sacrificial language (Rom. 12:1).

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest pastoral admonition.
* Polemical edge against passivity.
* Corporate address to conscience of the congregation.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "give Herren dit Hjerte" – biblical idiom for repentance and faith.
* "fremstille dig selv som et levende, helligt og Gud velbehageligt Offer" – direct echo of Romans 12:1 (KJV resonance essential).
* "prøve alt og beholde det gode" – 1 Thessalonians 5:21.
* "Naadegaverne" – Pauline language; avoid modern charismatic dilution.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Analogy: external order (treasurer) → spiritual order.
* Refutation of clerical monopolization of edification.
* Positive duty of congregation: use, discover, cultivate gifts.
* Means: preaching + mutual brotherly counsel.
* Warning against neglect of gifts.
* Concluding definition of the true congregation.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Romans 12:1 – living sacrifice.
* Matthew 25 – talents/pounds.
* 1 Corinthians 12 – gifts in the body.
* 1 Thessalonians 5:21 – test all things.
* General NT language of servants/handmaidens of the Lord.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain rebuke of "almindelige Opfatning" as folly.
* Preserve urgency and communal responsibility.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "kan og skal" → "can and must".
* "maa" consistently rendered with necessity.
* Avoid weakening imperatives into suggestions.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Menighed = congregation.
* Naadegaver = gifts of grace.
* Forkyndelse = proclamation/preaching.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Treasurer analogy retained fully.
* Gold-seeking metaphor preserved.
* Servant imagery maintained.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* From critique → exhortation → positive vision.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences preserved.
* Parallelisms retained.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

Naturally, we well understand the significance of outward order, so that when the congregation chooses a treasurer, not all others can be treasurers at the same time. Yet they can and must all come to the treasurer’s aid in keeping the financial affairs in good order. But just as foolish as it would be to suppose that the treasurer alone should procure the money and rule over the money, and that no one else should have the slightest concern with that matter, just so foolish—and indeed somewhat worse still—is the common notion that all work of edification in the congregation has once and for all been entrusted to the pastor, and that no other Christian can or should contribute anything to that cause with his spiritual gift or ability.

But the congregation must not only use the gifts it receives; it also lies upon it to discover and cultivate them, to call them forth and to foster them.

Here, first and foremost, the public proclamation of the Word must be called to account. It must not merely be said to a person and a member of the congregation’s outward organization that you must give the Lord your heart in a true and living faith, but also that you must present yourself as a living, holy, and God-pleasing sacrifice through a true, inward, and self-denying love toward God and neighbor. The proclamation must become congregational in character, so that light falls upon the calling and task of Christians as members of the congregation, upon their entrusted pounds and talents.

And not that alone. There must prevail a spirit of brotherhood and confidence within the congregation, so that one converses and deliberates with one another precisely about these questions: What shall we do, and how shall we do it? Who among us is fit, and what is the obligation of the one who is fit?

If one never seeks after the gifts of grace, then one will surely not find them; and thus it comes to pass at times that they almost must peep forth of themselves; and this is one of the reasons why many gifts are partly squandered and partly stored away among us.

We cannot afford this. The congregation ought to search for the gifts as for noble and precious gold, and thus “prove all things and hold fast that which is good,” also in this respect.

This, then, is the congregation’s true establishment in the world: a people of believing, praying, and working men and women, who receive from the Lord all that they need for their work, both faith and life and gifts, and who therefore acknowledge this wholly and fully, that they belong to the Lord with all that they are and all that they have, so that they are all the Lord’s servants and handmaidens, set by Him unto every good work.
