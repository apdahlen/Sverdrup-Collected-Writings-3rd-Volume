STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Alvor" – more than seriousness; moral gravity and spiritual earnestness.
* "Forkyndelsen" – proclamation/preaching with ecclesial authority.
* "Vækkelse" – revival in pietistic sense, not mere enthusiasm.
* "Menighedens Fremtræden" – the congregation’s true manifestation or coming into visible life.
* "Kirkefreden" – peace of the Church, both spiritual and institutional.
* "udstødte og fordrivne" – socially and ecclesially cast out, not merely marginalized.
* "nidkjære" – zealous with moral fervor.
* "gjengjælde ondt med godt" – biblically loaded ethical reversal.
* "bundnes Frihed" / "fangnes Løsladelse" – biblical liberation imagery.
* "Fanatisme" – spiritual rigidity rather than modern extremism.
* "Begynde ret" – begin rightly, in a morally correct and ordered way.
* "kostbar" – costly in sacrifice, not luxurious.
* "Lægedom" – healing in a deep, restorative sense.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long exhortational sentences with parallel imperatives.
* Semicolon logic reflecting sermonic flow.
* Repetition for rhetorical insistence.

Theological Hazards:

* Revival, church peace, freedom, reconciliation, and healing are doctrinally charged.
* Liberation language echoes Isaiah/Luke and must not be secularized.

Voice Hazards:

* Exhortational imperatives addressed to conscience.
* Earnest Lutheran pastoral tone must not be softened.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "gjengjælde ondt med godt" – Romans 12:17–21; must echo KJV cadence.
* "de bundnes Frihed og de fanges Løsladelse" – Isaiah 61 / Luke 4; spiritual captivity.
* "det er mørkest før Daggry" – proverbial but eschatologically hopeful.
* "Josefs Skade" – allusion to Genesis; a wound turned to saving good.
* "slimet Slangebugtning" – vivid metaphor for deceitful resistance; must retain imagery.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Call for greater seriousness in preaching.
* Assertion that revival leads to true congregational life and church peace.
* Ethical exhortation to repay evil with good.
* Vision of liberation leading to reopened churches.
* Missionary priority: rebuilding congregational life rightly.
* Acknowledgment of cost and difficulty.
* Pastoral encouragement despite despair.
* Eschatological hope grounded in biblical precedent.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Romans 12 – overcoming evil with good.
* Isaiah 61 / Luke 4 – liberty to captives.
* Genesis 50 – Joseph’s suffering turned to healing.
* Johannine/light imagery – night and day.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Imperatives retained.
* No softening of struggle or cost.
* Earnest, exhortational gravity preserved.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "Lad" rendered as strong exhortative imperative: "Let us" / "Let there be".
* Necessity and resolve maintained.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Menighed – congregation.
* Kirke – Church.
* Fred – peace (ecclesial and spiritual).
* Liv – life (spiritual vitality).

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Doors, keys, bonds, wounds, night/day preserved as metaphors.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* From urgency → hope → consolation.
* Despair acknowledged but not endorsed.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences retained where rhetorically necessary.
* Parallel imperatives preserved.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

Let there be greater earnestness in the proclamation, both of priests and of laymen! Let there be vigorous labor for awakening and for life! This is the way to the congregation’s true appearing; this is also the way to the peace of the Church.

Therefore love bids us who are cast out and driven away to be faithful and zealous in repaying evil with good. It is of great importance to labor for the freedom of the bound and the release of the captives. When the tight bonds of spiritual fanaticism and unyieldingness are broken, then the barred church doors also will be opened, and the keys turned in the new locks.

But above all, this labor for the congregation and its life is a chief matter in our missionary work. Where there is access to a new beginning, let us by all means seek to begin rightly.

It will be a difficult task and a costly task; yet it is a blessed work, which shall become healing for many wounds of the heart and many wounds of the Church.

Let us pursue it with joy and self-sacrificing love. We have suffered so much of the strife; let us at least attempt the little that we are able to do toward the peace, which is the free congregation.

It is said: it avails nothing, it avails nothing! It is so dark and hopeless, no end in sight—nothing but slimy, serpentine writhing to be met everywhere. Very well: it is darkest before the dawn, and the longer the night wears on, the nearer is the day. Joseph’s wound may yet be healed, and perhaps the turning now toward the better is nearer than we think.
