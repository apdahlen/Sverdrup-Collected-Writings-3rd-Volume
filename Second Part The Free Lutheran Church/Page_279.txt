STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Hovedsagen" — carries weight of central, decisive matter; not merely "main point" but that on which all else turns.
* "Lys" — theological metaphor (divine revelation, truth, Christ himself), not physical brightness.
* "Trivsel" — spiritual flourishing, health, vitality.
* "Sandhed" — doctrinal and revelatory truth, not subjective sincerity.
* "Forsumpes" — imagery of becoming a swamp: stagnation, decay.
* "Redskaber" — instruments raised by God; biblical vocational language.
* "Arbeidet" — active ministry/service, not generic labor.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long periodic sentences with parallel constructions that carry sermonic cadence.
* Antithetical pairings (light/dark, truth/judgment, love/hatred) that must remain balanced.
* Rhetorical questions used for exhortation, not inquiry.

Theological Hazards:

* Identification of Truth with Christ himself (Johannine Christology).
* Relationship between preaching, congregation, life, and death.
* Doctrine of means: preaching and communal labor as divinely ordered instruments.
* Spiritual death vs. life within the visible church.

Voice Hazards:

* Strong exhortational Lutheran tone.
* Warning against passivity and clericalism.
* Imagery meant to pierce conscience; must not be softened or modernized.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Lys, Lys og atter Lys" — emphatic repetition; echoes Johannine and Pauline light imagery (John 1; Ephesians 5).
* "Det bliver aldrig for lyst" — idiomatic assertion of inexhaustibility of divine truth.
* "Sandheden lyde fuldt ud" — proclamation without dilution; preaching in its fullness.
* "Kampen for Livet" — spiritual warfare motif.
* "Tændt Ild igjen" — revival imagery; echoes Acts 2 / Romans 12:11.
* "Forsumpes" — cultural-natural metaphor common in Nordic preaching.
* "Hyrer en Præst" — ironic critique of consumer Christianity.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

1. Thesis: The church’s chief matter is Light—divine truth.
2. Explanation: True flourishing depends on God’s light and truth.
3. Consequence: Full truth produces division as well as faith.
4. Christological center: Truth is Jesus Christ.
5. Means: True preaching builds the congregation; substitutes destroy it.
6. Ongoing conflict: Life in the congregation requires continual struggle.
7. Divine mercy: God revives even seemingly dead congregations.
8. Secondary means: Work/service as essential to congregational life.
9. Ecclesiology: The congregation is a body of workers, not spectators.
10. Result: Shared labor purifies the church from worldliness.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* John 8:12 — Christ as the Light.
* John 14:6 — Christ as the Truth.
* Hebrews 4:12 — Word as judging hearts.
* 1 Corinthians 3 — building up the church.
* Ephesians 4 — body with many members working.
* Matthew 9:37 — laborers in the harvest.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

Warnings, contrasts, and exhortations are retained with full severity.
No consolatory language is expanded beyond the original.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "maa" rendered as "must."
* Absolute statements remain absolute.
* Negatives remain uncompromising.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Lys → Light
* Sandhed → Truth
* Menighed → Congregation
* Arbeide → Work / labor (contextual but consistent)
* Liv / Død → Life / Death (capitalized when theological)

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Swamp imagery retained.
* Fire imagery retained.
* Choir metaphor retained intact.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Severity in warning.
* Hope in divine mercy.
* Practical exhortation in conclusion.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

Sentence length and parallelism largely preserved.
Semicolons retained where rhetorically necessary.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

And this is and remains the Chief Matter: Light, Light, and yet again Light in the Church. It can never be too light, nor light enough. Upon this rests the congregation’s true flourishing. In the light that comes from God, the good thrives, just as surely as the evil withers away. In God’s Truth there is nourishment for truth-seeking souls; in God’s Truth there is also a piercing judgment upon all dishonest and hypocritical hearts. Let the Truth sound forth in its fullness, and there will arise both tearing apart and resistance, both faith and hardening, both love and hatred.

But the Truth is Jesus Christ. Only through a true preaching of Christ does there come to be a congregation. Let it sound forth, and the congregation is built and grows and is strengthened; put something else in its place, however popular it may be, and the congregation becomes bogged down and corrupted, and loses more and more of its true nature and its true strength.

This is the struggle for Life in the congregation. It must be kept going at all times, so long as the congregation is here below. It never ceases, except where spiritual Death gains complete dominion.

And God, who is rich in mercy, has graciously so guided and ordered it that even there, where everything seems to be Death and decay, He has awakened or sent instruments who have kindled fire again where it had been extinguished.

But where the preaching is as it ought to be, there comes another means as well, which we shall also mention: the work.

The congregation lives and exists in order to work. It is a gathering of workers. A congregation is not organized unless there is work for all. It is no congregation where a group of people “hire” a pastor to work for them, so that they themselves may be spared. No, the congregation may in this respect be likened to a choir, which must have a choirmaster to lead and instruct. Is the instructor to sing alone? Are not all to take part? So it is in the congregation: it is a gathering of God’s servants, men and women, who labor for God’s kingdom, for the cause of Christ. The leader does not become superfluous, but all the more necessary, in such a host.

And this work will also help to purify the congregation and keep it free from worldliness. If all have enough to do with spiritual labor and spiritual concerns, then the worldly elements will indeed find it cramped enough within the congregation.
