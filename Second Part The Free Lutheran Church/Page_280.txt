STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Kjød og Blod" – biblical idiom (flesh and blood) denoting natural human weakness, not merely physicality.
* "Kors" – not metaphorical hardship in general, but participation in Christ’s suffering and discipleship.
* "Jesu Spor" – following in Jesus’ footsteps; discipleship imagery.
* "Menighed" – congregation/church understood as the gathered believers, not an institution.
* "Verdsliggjørelse" – worldliness/secularization; spiritual accommodation to the world.
* "Stenstød" – stumbling stone/offense; biblical resonance.
* "Vrængbillede" – grotesque distortion or caricature; strong polemical force.
* "Naadegaver" – gifts of grace/charismata; must retain Pauline resonance.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long hypotactic sentences with causal chains that must not be flattened.
* Frequent use of purpose clauses ("for at") carrying theological logic.
* Parallel constructions that reinforce exhortational cadence.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of the cross (discipleship through suffering).
* Ecclesiology: nature, authority, and preservation of the congregation.
* Authority of Word and Spirit as absolute norm.
* Danger of hypocrisy and false membership.

Voice Hazards:

* Exhortational Lutheran sermonic tone.
* Sharp warnings against spiritual complacency.
* Earnest pastoral urgency that must not be softened.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Kjød og Blod" – cf. Matt. 16:17; Eph. 6:12; rendered naturally as "flesh and blood."
* "tage op sit Kors" – Matt. 16:24; Luke 9:23; should echo KJV diction.
* "Stenstød" – Rom. 9:33; 1 Pet. 2:8; rendered as "stumbling-stone" or "offense."
* "Kristi Legeme og Jesu Brud" – 1 Cor. 12; Eph. 5; Rev. 21; ecclesial metaphors must remain vivid.
* "Naadegaver" – 1 Cor. 12–14; Rom. 12; translated as "gifts of grace" or "spiritual gifts."

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: The congregation must embrace the cross in concrete labor to remain truly the church.
* Support: Ease-through-numbers leads to weakness; vitality-through-sacrifice leads to power.
* Warning: Failure to resist worldliness results in disgrace and distortion.
* Pivot: Necessity of organization acknowledged alongside danger of hypocrisy.
* Appeal: Vigilance and cross-bearing as God-given means of preservation.
* Doctrinal conclusion: Only the gospel of the cross preserves the church.
* Transition to polity: Self-government under Word and Spirit.
* Doctrinal grounding: Christianity as absolute dependence and freedom in God.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Matt. 16:24 – taking up the cross.
* 1 Cor. 1:18 – the word of the cross.
* Eph. 5:25–27 – the Bride of Christ.
* 1 Cor. 12 – Body of Christ.
* John 8:36 – freedom in Christ.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain uncompromising warnings.
* Preserve polemical sharpness in "Vrængbillede" imagery.
* Maintain exhortational directness toward the conscience.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "maa" – must / must of necessity.
* "vil" – volitional certainty, not mere futurity.
* Negations ("ikke") must remain absolute where intended.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Menighed – congregation.
* Kors – cross.
* Ord og Aand – Word and Spirit.
* Naadegaver – gifts of grace / spiritual gifts.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Cross-bearing imagery retained.
* Body/Bride metaphors preserved without explanation.
* Light/offense imagery left vivid.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Severity in warnings.
* Positive exhortation toward strength and life.
* Doctrinal clarity in polity section.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences preserved where rhetorically intentional.
* Semicolon logic retained.
* KJV-like rhythm favored.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

Let the work be made so heavy for flesh and blood that it becomes a true Cross to bear in the footsteps of Jesus; and this will help the congregation exceedingly to be a truly living congregation. Then it would not be a matter of becoming many in order to make things easy, but a matter of becoming living and strong, so that the Lord’s work might be done with power.

That congregation which by these means will not resist its own worldliness will soon lie under it; and it will become a stumbling-stone for the name of God instead of being for the glory of the Lord and a light to the world. When, therefore, we acknowledge that the congregation must have an outward organization, and at the same time acknowledge that there is opportunity for hypocrites to creep into the organization, this becomes the strongest summons to be on guard and to use the means the Lord has given us, lest the enemies of the congregation become its masters through the congregation’s sloth and unwillingness to take up its cross and bear its burdens. Only the Gospel of the Cross and the Cross of the Gospel can preserve the congregation, so that it does not become a hostile caricature of the Body of Christ and the Bride of Jesus.

The Self-Government of the Congregation and the Use of the Gifts of Grace

“5. The congregation governs its own affairs under the authority of God’s Word and Spirit, and acknowledges no other ecclesiastical authority or power over itself.

6. The free congregation esteems and loves all the spiritual gifts which the Lord bestows for its edification, and seeks to quicken the gifts and promote their use.”

If it is true, as God’s Word testifies, that the congregation consists of the believers in each place, who in that place have formed an organization in order to labor for the Kingdom of God, then it follows of necessity that the congregation is self-governing and independent of other men in this its work.

For Christianity is, in its inmost essence, a relation to God, which entails a complete dependence upon Him and yet a complete freedom in Him.

If, therefore, no other men have authority over the congregation in its congregational work, then the congregation has in the fullest measure an authority over it, namely the Word and the Spirit. And so absolute is this authority, that the congregation is no longer a congregation when it tears itself away from it; and only so far is the congregation truly congregation as it follows this authority.
