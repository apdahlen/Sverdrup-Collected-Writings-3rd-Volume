STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* Principer – not merely "principles" in a loose sense, but foundational governing principles.
* Frikirken – Free Church, not generic "free church" but a theological-ecclesial concept.
* Menighedssagen – the question/matter of the congregation/church community.
* Kirkeforfatningen – church polity or constitution, not merely organization.
* Kløgt og Spidsfindighed – human cleverness and casuistic subtlety, often negatively charged.
* barnlig Trofast – childlike fidelity/faithfulness, echoing biblical language.
* umyndige – spiritually simple or unlearned, not legally underage.
* levende kristne – living/true Christians, spiritually alive.
* Aandens Udgyldelse – the outpouring of the Spirit (Pentecost).
* Menigheden – congregation/church as theological reality, not mere assembly.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long periodic sentences with semicolons and cumulative clauses.
* Sermonic pacing that resists modern sentence fragmentation.
* Embedded scriptural citations woven into argument.

Theological Hazards:

* Authority of Scripture as decisive norm in doctrine and church order.
* Doctrine of the Kingdom of God: already present yet still coming.
* Pneumatology: Spirit as life-giving, constitutive of the Church.
* Ecclesiology: Church as divinely instituted form of the Kingdom.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest exhortational tone addressing conscience and responsibility.
* Polemical rejection of rationalistic cleverness.
* Pastoral gravity that must not be softened or modernized.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Guds Ords afgjørende Authoritet" – echoes sola Scriptura; decisive authority, not advisory.
* "barnlig Trofast" – Matthew 18 resonance; childlike faithfulness.
* "Ordets Lys skinner" – biblical metaphor (Ps. 119:105; John 1).
* "Guds Rige er nær / er her" – direct gospel proclamation (Matt. 3:2; 4:17).
* "anden Bøn i Faderbor" – "Thy kingdom come" (Lord’s Prayer).
* "Retfærdighed, Fred og Glæde i den Helligaand" – Romans 14:17.
* "den nye Skabning" – 2 Corinthians 5:17; corporate as well as individual.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Supreme principle: the decisive authority of God’s Word.
* Methodological consequence: obedience, not clever reasoning.
* Practical implication: all true Christians share responsibility.
* Hierarchy of concerns: after personal salvation, the congregation.
* Biblical framing of the Kingdom: near → present → still coming.
* Distinction of inner essence and outer form of the Kingdom.
* Christ’s purpose: founding not only inner renewal but a community.
* Fulfillment through redemptive-historical acts.
* Apostolic continuation as Spirit-driven necessity.
* Exclusive New Testament witness to this single form of the Kingdom.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Authority of the Word – Matthew 4; Reformation hermeneutic.
* Childlike faith – Matthew 18:3.
* Word as light – Psalm 119:105; John 1:9.
* Kingdom proclamation – Synoptic Gospels.
* Lord’s Prayer – Matthew 6:10.
* Romans 14:17 explicitly cited.
* New creation – 2 Corinthians 5:17.
* Pentecost – Acts 2.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain firmness against rationalism.
* Preserve urgency of ecclesial responsibility.
* Retain gravity of salvation and church as ultimate concerns.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "kan og bør" → "can and ought".
* "er der ingen" → categorical assertion, not probabilistic.
* "maa" (implicit necessity) retained as divine necessity.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Guds Rige → the Kingdom of God.
* Menigheden → the Congregation / the Church (consistent usage).
* Aand / Helligaand → Spirit / Holy Spirit.
* Ord → the Word (capitalized when theological).

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Light shining equally on simple and wise.
* Kingdom growing and filling the earth.
* New creation contrasted with the old.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Instruction → exhortation → proclamation → doctrinal exposition.
* Warning against neglect balanced with hopeful assurance.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Retain long sentences with rhythmic balance.
* Preserve parallelisms and cumulative clauses.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

Above all other principles in the Free Church there stands, namely, the decisive authority of God’s Word in the matter of the congregation and the constitution of the Church, fully as much as in questions of doctrine.

It is therefore not by cleverness and subtle ingenuity that we seek to find the way, but by childlike faithfulness to the Lord’s Word. And therefore there are no living Christians who cannot and ought not to take part in the resolution of the question of the congregation; for the light of the Word shines as well for the simple as for the wise and understanding, and indeed most readily for the former, so that no one is exempt from occupying himself seriously and sincerely with all that belongs to the Kingdom of God. And next to the question of the salvation of the individual soul, there is no more important question than that of the congregation.

“The Kingdom of God is at hand”—such was the cry of John and the preaching of Jesus and His disciples before the outpouring of the Spirit. Since then it may be said that Christian preaching in this respect sounds thus: “The Kingdom of God is here”; yet of course always coming anew and ever reaching forward to more, according to the second petition in the Lord’s Prayer.

The Kingdom of God has its inner essence, which is righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit. It also has its outward form, which is the congregation, the people of the Spirit in the world.

It was Jesus’ purpose in His coming into the world to bring the Kingdom of God. And He would not merely bring a spiritual benefaction into hearts, but He would also have a new community, which He Himself has given the name Congregation.

What Jesus willed, that He accomplished through death, resurrection, ascension, and the outpouring of the Spirit. Then the Kingdom of God came in the form of the congregation, endowed with the power to live and grow and propagate itself, so that “the new creation” might become manifold and fill the earth as the old once did; yet by new means—by God’s Word and Spirit—was this expansion and diffusion to take place.

For this form of the Kingdom of God, which is the congregation, all the apostles and all the first Christians thereafter labored, because the Spirit drove them thereto. And within the revelation of the New Testament there is no mention of any other form of the Kingdom of God.
