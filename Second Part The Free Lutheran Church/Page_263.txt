STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Frikirkelig Arbeide" – carries ecclesiological and pietistic meaning; must not be reduced to generic "free church work."
* "Fredsarbeide" – not merely peacekeeping, but church peace grounded in evangelical freedom.
* "Menighed" – theological term; must remain "congregation," not generalized community.
* "Levendegjørelse" – spiritual quickening or enlivening; avoid psychological language.
* "Frigjørelse" – ecclesial freedom under God, not political liberation.
* "Samfund" – denotes organized church bodies/parties; quotation marks signal critique.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long argumentative sentences with conditional logic must be preserved.
* Parallel imperatives (“Giv Rum… lad hver… bind dem ikke…”) require rhythmic retention.
* Sermonic pacing should not be modernized into short sentences.

Theological Hazards:

* Congregational freedom under the Spirit and Word must remain doctrinally precise.
* Avoid weakening pneumatology (“Herrens Aand”).
* Maintain New Testament grounding of ecclesiology.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest, exhortational Lutheran tone must not be smoothed.
* Polemical edge against party-ecclesiology must remain clear but measured.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Bind dem ikke sammen i Knipper" – vivid metaphor: binding sheaves; implies coercive institutionalism.
* "Freden gammel nok til at komme" – idiomatic assurance; peace will come in due time.
* "Det kommer an paa Herrens Aand" – echoes Zechariah 4:6; success by the Spirit.
* "Landskamp for det heltes Vel" – national struggle for the common good; rhetorical minimization of numbers.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: Free church work is the only practical church-union work, namely peace work.
* Support: True peace comes when congregations are left free and unbound.
* Clarification: Small beginnings are normal; success depends on the Spirit.
* Inclusion: Participation open to all aligned with the purpose.
* Caution: Rules for a Lutheran free church require careful scrutiny.
* Core claim: Congregation is the center of gravity; free church emerges naturally.
* Definition: "Free church" defined as congregational self-determination under God.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Zechariah 4:6 – not by might, but by my Spirit.
* New Testament ecclesiology – congregational life under Word and Spirit.
* Implicit Pauline freedom language.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain firmness against ecclesial party constraints.
* Retain confidence without triumphalism.
* Preserve exhortational clarity.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* Imperatives (“Giv,” “lad,” “bind ikke”) must remain commands.
* Necessity and certainty must not be softened.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Menighed = congregation
* Frikirke = free church
* Aand = Spirit
* Frihed = freedom (theological)

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Sheaves/binding imagery retained.
* Center of gravity metaphor preserved.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Warning and encouragement held together.
* Polemic balanced with pastoral hope.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences preserved where rhetorically intentional.
* Clause rhythm maintained for proclamation.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

This free‑church work is therefore the only practical work toward ecclesiastical union—or rather, toward peace. Give room for all congregations; let each of them have its freedom and independence unimpaired; bind them not together into sheaves with the bands of denominational constitutions—and then peace is old enough to come of itself.

If the work has so great an aim, it must of course be content to begin quite small. It is never many who begin a national struggle for the common good. Yet we hold this faith, that it does not depend upon the many or the few, but that it depends upon the Spirit of the Lord, whether such a work shall succeed.

But whether one stands within a “church body” or outside of a “church body,” all are equally welcome to take part in the free‑church work, provided they are agreed in this purpose: the enlivening and the freeing of the congregations.

---

The proposed rules for a Lutheran free church cannot be weighed too carefully, nor criticized too sharply. For a Lutheran free church, in which the congregations truly enjoy that freedom of God and of the Spirit which belongs to them according to the New Testament, is something new—at least here in America. It has been so, and it is still quite common today, that there is almost no way of entering into a Lutheran congregation without at the same time having to become a member of a churchly party.

But when a cause is so new, it is altogether certain that it is of great importance to proceed with caution. And the right caution consists in laying as much weight as possible upon the congregation, that it may attain its proper spiritual standing among us according to the Word of God; for there lies the strength and the center of gravity of the free church, and when the congregation comes forward, then there becomes a “free church” of itself.

For “free church” means, so far as I understand anything of it, nothing other than this: that the congregations are granted leave to be and to work in freedom for the cause of the Kingdom of God—not as other people or congregations determine it for them, but as they themselves determine it.
