STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* Menigheden – not merely a voluntary association, but the visible congregation/church as a spiritual body.
* Embedsmænd – church officers, not secular officials.
* Stemmeret – participatory right of decision, not modern political voting.
* Ufuldkommenhed/Fuldkommenhed – moral and eschatological completeness, not mere efficiency.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long periodic sentences with subordinate clauses that carry theological reasoning.
* Parenthetical clarifications that must remain intact.
* Scriptural quotations embedded within argument.

Theological Hazards:

* Baptism as entry into the Church.
* Confession of sin and faith in the risen Christ.
* Equality of believers in church governance.
* Edification, order, and spiritual gifts in worship.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest, didactic Lutheran tone.
* Polemic against modern speculation and accommodation to the age.
* Scriptural cadence and exhortational gravity.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "udvortes Handling" – outward act; emphasizes visible, sacramental action.
* "vaktert og sømmeligt ordnede" – guarded and seemly ordered; moral and spiritual decorum.
* "Grækerne en Daarlighed og Jøderne en Forargelse" – direct Pauline allusion (1 Cor. 1:23).

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: The early Church could count its members because baptism defined membership.
* Support: Baptism was voluntary and confessional, yet outward and countable.
* Extension: Congregational participation necessitated shared governance.
* Evidence: Apostolic practice and Pauline description of worship.
* Conclusion: Scripture sufficiently instructs church order for all times.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Acts 6:2 – "the whole multitude of the disciples."
* 1 Corinthians 14:26 – order and edification in worship.
* 1 Corinthians 1:23 – Christ crucified as folly and stumbling block.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain firmness against modern ecclesial relativism.
* Preserve reverent admiration of apostolic order.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "maatte" – must/was required.
* "kan tælle" – is able to count, not merely may.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Menigheden – the Congregation.
* Daaben – Baptism.
* Sammenkomster – assemblies.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Light as scriptural illumination.
* Order vs. disorder as moral-spiritual realities.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Calm exposition → polemical warning → scriptural conclusion.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Preserve long sentences and semicolon logic.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

That the Congregation can number its members and record them follows, according to the testimony of the New Testament, quite directly from this: that it receives its members through Baptism. It is an outward act, so external in its form, to baptize, that it is a very simple matter to count how many are baptized. That no one was compelled by worldly law to be baptized, and that no one was baptized who did not confess his sins and his faith in the risen Jesus, is of course self-evident to every attentive reader of the Bible. Yet, as said, this outward act made the persons easy to recognize and to count.

And that the Congregation had to choose officers and make other determinations—which arose rather from the Congregation’s imperfection than from its perfection—entailed the use of a right of participation, which according to Acts 6:2 and other passages belonged to “the whole multitude of the disciples,” so that there was no difference of degree between those who governed and those who were governed; they were all sharers in the governance, insofar as they were members of the Congregation.

Nor is there any doubt that the Congregation, from the very beginning, had its regular assemblies, and that these assemblies, in all their unique freedom, were nevertheless guarded and seemly ordered. Read Paul’s movingly simple description of the assembly in 1 Corinthians 14:26: “What is it then, brethren? When ye come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation; let all things be done unto edifying.” And the following verses in the same chapter give still more exact insight into the life and the order that existed in the assemblies. There is no rigidity and affected solemnity; neither is there disorder and arbitrary self-exaltation of one at the expense of others.

Truly, the Lord has not abandoned His Congregation to human cleverness and subtle speculation, as many suppose, so that we should have no instruction concerning “church polity” in the Bible and must devise something “suited to the times.” There is light enough for the Congregation in the New Testament, and it is not worth allowing anyone to persuade himself that it does not suit “our time.” It did not suit worldly people any better then than it does now. It has always been, and will always remain, to the Greeks foolishness and to the Jews a stumbling block—the crucified Christ and His Congregation.
