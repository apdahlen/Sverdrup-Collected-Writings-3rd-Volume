STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* Menighed: not merely “congregation” sociologically, but the spiritually constituted body of believers.
* Partivæsenet: factionalism/party-spirit with ecclesial overtones.
* Broderskab: spiritual fraternity grounded in Christ, not mere friendliness.
* Samfund / Samfundet: can mean fellowship or association; here contrasted between human-constituted bodies and Spirit-built communion.
* Botemiddel: remedy/cure with penitential resonance.
* Kirkelige Sønderrivelse: ecclesial rending/tearing-apart; not mild “division.”
* Hierarkiets Fare: danger of ecclesiastical hierarchy/clerical domination.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long, sermon-like sentences with cumulative clauses.
* Rhetorical questions intended to press the conscience.
* Parallel constructions contrasting true/false brotherhood.
* Semicolon logic that should not be modernized into short sentences.

Theological Hazards:

* Frelse of “the sleeping”: spiritual deadness, not physical sleep.
* Guds Aands Virke: active agency of the Holy Spirit, not abstract influence.
* Menighedens Frihed og Ret: theological liberty, not political rights alone.
* Kristus in his Menighed: mystical union ecclesiology.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest exhortational Lutheran tone.
* Prophetic rebuke of factionalism.
* Hope mingled with suffering and patience.
* Any smoothing would dull the sermonic gravity.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* “de sovendes Frelse” echoes Pauline language of spiritual sleep (Rom 13:11; Eph 5:14).
* Christ’s synagogue visits recall Gospel patterns (Matt 4:23).
* “Tornegjærder mellem Folkets Hjerter” is figurative—thorn hedges = barriers of hostility.
* “Dødsstødet” is decisive deathblow, not gradual weakening.
* “Frigjørelse af Hjerter” carries revivalist-pietistic resonance of inward liberation.
* KJV parallels: “brotherhood,” “bond,” “temple of the Lord,” “work and suffer.”

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: The congregation is obligated to labor for the salvation of the spiritually sleeping.
* Scriptural exempla: Christ, Paul, and Jerusalem church model fearless, outward exhortation.
* Governing principle: Love asks only whether good can be done.
* Diagnosis: Factionalism arises where congregational freedom is denied.
* Vision: True brotherhood across congregations grounded in Christ.
* Lament: The goal is distant and costly.
* Remedy: The Spirit’s work restoring true congregational life.
* Polemic: Church-political organs oppose the congregational idea.
* Defense: Inter-congregational trust accords with Scripture and apostolic practice.
* Conclusion: The supreme task of the present age is the work for the congregation.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Synagogue preaching: Matt 4:23; Luke 4:16–21.
* Apostolic exhortation letters: Acts 15.
* Bonds of brotherhood: Eph 4:3.
* Temple imagery: Ezra/Nehemiah; 1 Cor 3:16.
* Walking in the Spirit vs human structures: Gal 5:16–25.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain warnings against factionalism.
* Preserve urgency and moral seriousness.
* Avoid sentimental or conciliatory dilution.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* “lige forpligtet” = equally bound/obligated.
* “maa naaes” = must be attained.
* “kan det være nogen Ulykke?” = strong rhetorical denial.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Menighed = congregation (capitalized when theological).
* Broderskab = brotherhood.
* Guds Aand = Spirit of God / God’s Spirit.
* Partivæsenet = factionalism.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Thorn hedges, deathblow, invisible chain, ruins of the Lord’s temple retained.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Lament → exhortation → hope.
* Severity toward error; encouragement toward faithfulness.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences preserved where intentional.
* Rhetorical questions kept intact.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

The Congregation is equally bound to labor for the salvation of those who sleep. Jesus visited every synagogue into which He could gain entrance, and the Temple itself bore witness to the mighty revelation of His power, despite the displeasure of His adversaries. And Paul preached wherever he came, despite the rulers of the synagogues. And the Congregation in Jerusalem wrote to all the congregations and exhorted them.

There is but one consideration which the Congregation takes, and that is love’s own consideration, namely this question: Can we accomplish any good? Where no benefit is done, love itself commands that one refrain from doing any harm.

If the freedom and right of the Congregation were but in the least acknowledged among us, factionalism and its many thorn hedges between the hearts of the people would soon be compelled to yield. The brotherhood which rests upon communion with Christ in His Congregation would then be able to thrive; and that brotherhood which exists only within the party would disappear before the true and rightful brotherhood.

Yet it is far to the goal which must be attained if we are to be well-pleasing to God. From congregation to congregation must the holy bond of brotherhood be knit, without the constraining bonds of the associations.

Will it ever be attained? In any case, it is a worthy goal to labor and to suffer for.

Many are those who have suffered and who suffer exceedingly under the ecclesiastical rending of our people. There is but one remedy: the working of God’s Spirit unto the liberation of hearts and congregations. When the Congregation becomes what it ought to be, then factionalism receives its deathblow. It is therefore exceedingly characteristic to observe the zeal with which the church-political organs among us labor against the congregational idea. They seem to perceive nothing but calamity and corruption in it.

But that congregation should care for congregation; that congregation should have trust and confidence in congregation; that a believing person should be well received from congregation to congregation; that there should be an invisible chain which binds together those who serve the same Lord and contend for the same cause—how can this be any calamity? Does this not accord with the Word of God and the Spirit of God, with the inmost essence of Christianity and with apostolic practice?

The matter stands thus: one believes in the association which men build by constitutions; one esteems so little the communion which God builds by the Spirit.

Therefore we conclude with the same with which we began: the task is to bring forth the Congregation from the rubble and to rebuild the ruins of the Lord’s Temple among men. And if we do not reach far— as is indeed to be expected under our own great and dreadful sloth and weakness and the adversaries’ enormous preponderance, humanly speaking—well then, we count it certain that to labor for the right goal is itself right; and we are altogether assured of this, that the day shall come when all truth-loving souls shall see it clearly in the light of the Spirit, that no labor is more urgently required in the present time than the labor for the Congregation.

It is the only labor which guards against the danger of hierarchy on the one side and the danger of individualism on the other. Let it go forward with power!
