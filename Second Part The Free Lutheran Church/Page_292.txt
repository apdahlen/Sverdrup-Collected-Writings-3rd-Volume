STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* Menigheden: not merely “congregation” in a sociological sense, but the spiritually constituted church-as-assembly.
* Kjærlighedens eget Hensyn: love’s own regard/consideration, echoing agape.
* Gavn / ondt: benefit/good versus moral harm, not mere utility.
* Partivæsenet: factionalism/party-spirit with ecclesial polemical weight.

* Hierarkiets Fare / Individualismens Fare: twin ecclesial dangers.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long periodic sentences with semicolon logic.
* Parallel clauses reinforcing exhortation.
* Rhetorical questions demanding preservation.
* Accumulative cadence suited for proclamation.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of church unity grounded in communion with Christ.
* Pneumatological emphasis (Spirit builds the church).
* Opposition between human constitutionalism and divine spiritual building.
* Sanctified suffering for ecclesial renewal.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest exhortational Lutheran tone.
* Appeals to conscience and perseverance.
* Polemical edge against party-spirit without rancor.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* “Hvor der ikke gjøres Gavn…”: ethical maxim grounded in love (cf. Rom. 13).

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: Love and true congregational life alone heal division.
* Diagnosis: Party-spirit fractures hearts and churches.
* Remedy: The Spirit’s work restoring true congregational freedom.

* Polemical critique kept firm, not softened.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Aand = Spirit.
* Partivæsen = party-spirit/factionalism.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Lament over suffering.
* Polemic against opponents.
* Hopeful eschatological confidence.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences preserved where rhetorical force demands.
* Semicolon pivots maintained.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

There is only one consideration which the congregation takes into account, and that is love’s own consideration—namely this question: Can we accomplish any good? Where no benefit is wrought, love commands that we refrain from doing any harm.

If the freedom and right of the congregation were even in the slightest degree acknowledged among us, the spirit of party and its many thorn-hedges between the hearts of the people would soon be forced to give way. The brotherhood which rests upon communion with Christ in His congregation would then be able to flourish; and that brotherhood which exists only within the party would vanish before the true and rightful brotherhood.

But it is a long way to the goal which must be reached if we are to be well-pleasing to God. From congregation to congregation the sacred bonds of brotherhood must be knit, without the constraining bonds of the societies.

Will it ever be attained? In any case, it is a worthy goal to labor and to suffer for.

Many there are who have suffered and still suffer exceedingly under the ecclesiastical rending of our people. There is only one remedy: the working of God’s Spirit unto the liberation of hearts and congregations. When the congregation becomes what it ought to be, then the party-spirit receives its death-blow. It is therefore extraordinarily characteristic to behold the zeal with which the church-political organs among us labor against the congregational idea. They seem to see nothing but calamity and corruption in it.

But that congregation has care for congregation; that congregation has trust and confidence in congregation; that a believing person is well received from congregation to congregation; that there is an invisible chain which binds together those who serve the same Lord and contend for the same cause—how can this be any calamity? Does this not accord with God’s Word and God’s Spirit, with the innermost essence of Christianity and with apostolic practice?

The matter is this: men believe in the fellowship which human beings build by constitutions; they esteem but little the fellowship which God builds by the Spirit.

Therefore we will conclude with the same with which we began: the task is to bring the congregation forth from the rubble and to rebuild the ruins of the Lord’s temple among men. And if we do not reach far—which indeed is to be expected under our own great and dreadful sluggishness and weakness, and the opponents’ enormous preponderance, humanly speaking—very well: we deem it wise to labor for the right goal, and we are altogether certain of this, that the day shall come when all souls that love the truth shall see it clearly in the light of the Spirit, that no real labor is more urgently required in the present time than the labor for the congregation.

It is the only labor which guards against the danger of hierarchy on the one side and the danger of individualism on the other. Let it go forward with power!
