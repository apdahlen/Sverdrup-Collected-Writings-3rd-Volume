STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Josefs Skade" – biblical-metaphorical phrase (Gen. 42:1, Amos 6:6), denoting the breach or calamity among God’s people; not a literal injury.
* "Samfund" – ecclesial body/denomination, not generic society.
* "Dannelsen" – formation/establishment, with institutional-theological weight.
* "Berettigelsen" – legitimacy/justification in a moral-theological sense.
* "Indremission" / "Hedningemission" – established Lutheran mission movements; must retain historical specificity.
* "læges / lægt" – heal/mend (biblical register), not merely fix or solve.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long hypotactic sentences with cascading conditional clauses.
* Rhetorical questions accumulating force across paragraphs.
* Semicolon logic and dash pivots that must not be flattened.

Theological Hazards:

* Unity of the Church vs. sectarian fragmentation.
* Implicit doctrine of the Church as one body under God’s will.
* Despair vs. hope in divine restoration.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest, admonitory editorial tone addressing the conscience.
* Irony and lament must not become sarcasm or neutrality.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "læge Josefs Skade" – to heal the breach among God’s people (cf. Amos 6:6, KJV: “the affliction of Joseph”).
* "ett Hjerte og én Vei" – Jeremiah 32:39; unity of will and walk before God.
* "lade Tingene gaa sin skjeve Gang" – to let matters run their crooked course; moral resignation.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Observation of present ecclesial fragmentation.
* Ironical inference: unity-work appears almost sinful.
* Conditional argument: if present sectarianism is truly Christian, then healing the breach must be wrong.
* Escalation to despair: has deviation become irreversible?
* Final rhetorical question pressing the temptation to abandon hope.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* "Josefs Skade" – Amos 6:6; Genesis tradition.
* "ett Hjerte og én Vei" – Jeremiah 32:39.
* Implicit Pauline ecclesiology (one body).

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

Warnings and irony are retained without softening. Despair is posed as a temptation, not endorsed.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "maa" rendered as "must".
* "Bør vi" rendered as "Ought we".
* Rhetorical permissions (“have leave to despair”) preserved.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Samfund → communion/denominational body (consistently).
* Læge/skade → heal/breach.
* Kirke → Church.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Healing imagery preserved.
* Devouring imagery (one body swallowing another) retained.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Movement from irony → argument → despair.
* No tonal leveling.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences preserved where rhetorically intentional.
* Question chains maintained.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

Ought we to labour for the healing of Joseph’s breach?

[Source: Editorial article in *Folkelbladet*, March 17, 1897. — Ed.]

When we look upon the development among us in ecclesiastical matters, one is almost led to believe that it must be something evil to labour for the healing of “Joseph’s breach.”

For when we see one communion fortifying itself against another, and exerting all its strength to work for itself and its own, and seeking to crowd out others; and when this is praised and extolled as the right and only Christian course—then one must surely ask whether it can at the same time be right to labour for any other kind of union than that one communion should swallow up all the others and annihilate them?

If the present condition and manner of ecclesial labour is right and Christian; if it is legitimate for a communion to split its theological school, to split its home mission, to split its heathen mission, to split its own congregations for the sake of the communion and for no other reason—how then can it also be right or Christian to attempt to heal Joseph’s breach?

And even if it were right to seek healing, and to think and believe that according to God’s will there ought to be “one heart and one way” in His kingdom—has not the deviation from this become so great that it is altogether useless to think of any change or improvement? Ought we not to be permitted to despair and give up? Or when, in the smallness and childishness that belong to our church history, we experience such things as peace proposals being met with suspicion and lawsuits—then is it not most proper to abandon all hope of any good future for our Church, and let matters go their crooked way?
