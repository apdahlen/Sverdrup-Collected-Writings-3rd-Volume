STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Forenede Kirke" – denotes a specific united church body, not a vague unity; must not be generalized.
* "Yderlighed" – means extremity/excess, with moral judgment.
* "Hensigtsmæssighedshensyn" – pragmatic expediency, not principled reasoning.
* "Kirketugt" – ecclesiastical discipline with strong doctrinal weight; not mere punishment.
* "Borgersamfundet" – civil society/state, distinct from church polity.
* "Menighed" – congregation as a theological entity, not just a gathering.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long argumentative sentences with semicolons and causal chains.
* Contrastive clauses marked by "men" that carry rhetorical force.
* Enumerative logic (For det første… Dernæst… endelig…).

Theological Hazards:

* Authority of God’s Word over church governance.
* Misuse of church discipline.
* Distinction between church and civil authority.
* Congregational independence (ecclesiology).

Voice Hazards:

* Sharp polemical tone against majority tyranny.
* Earnest warning against unscriptural church practices.
* Moral gravity must not be softened.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "føre det til en Yderlighed" – to push something to an extreme; implies reckless excess.
* "bitter Smag" – metaphor for bitter consequences.
* "samle Guds Kirke og ikke adsprede den" – biblical echo (cf. John 11:52); unity vs. scattering.
* "herske over" – to lord it over (cf. Matthew 20:25–26).

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Description of abuse in the United Church.
* Contrast with civil society and American context.
* Thesis: pure majority rule is dangerous in the Church.
* First ground: supremacy of God’s Word.
* Second ground: fallibility of majorities.
* Final ground: biblical congregational independence.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Authority of the Word (Isaiah 55; 2 Timothy 3).
* Gathering vs. scattering God’s people (John 11:52).
* Warning against domination in the Church (Matthew 20:25–28).

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

Warnings and judgments must remain firm, especially terms like "næsten Galskab" (almost madness).

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "kan man da heldigvis ikke gjøre" – must retain impossibility.
* "er umulig" – absolute impossibility.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Kirke – Church
* Menighed – Congregation
* Guds Ord – Word of God
* Kirketugt – Church discipline

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Bitter taste
* Driving out/excluding

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* From narrative critique → doctrinal warning → biblical principle.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Preserve long sentences and sermonic rhythm.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

In the United Church one has sought to carry this to an extremity, which I believe was not adopted from principle, but out of considerations of expediency. It was a convenient means of displacing the Augsburgers, who were in the minority. And because it appeared convenient, one therefore went to such an extreme as is impossible in civil society: one not only denied the minority all influence, even the most rightful, but simply drove it out of the community and then called this expulsion—church discipline. This, happily, one cannot do in the United States; the minority has the right to remain within the community and to seek to become the majority. But in the Church it is so easy to resort to church discipline and to cast out those whom the majority does not like.

But, as said, it is perilous for many reasons to establish mere majority rule in the Church. Perhaps the United Church is even now already beginning to taste something of the bitterness of those dangerous methods which were employed to displace the Augsburgers from congregations and church fellowship.

For, in the first place, the Church is dependent upon the Word of God and its authority and truth before there can be any talk of majority and minority. This limitation of majority rule is of such compelling importance that where it is not heeded and respected, there the Church soon ceases to be Church. In other words, it is a fundamental matter in the Church that the Word be allowed to retain its proper authority.

Next, there is the imperfection to be considered, that there is no guarantee that the majority alone possesses good powers and sound judgments. At times there may be capable men and wise counsel in the minority. Therefore to exclude the minority from all influence and to expel it from the community, in order that it may never become the majority, is almost madness for those who wish to gather God’s Church and not to scatter it.

And, not to go through everything, there is finally this distinctive feature of the Church’s apostolic and biblical order: that the congregation is free, self-governing, and independent in its very essence, so that it stands under no human or ecclesiastical authority. Congregations may cooperate with other congregations in all freedom and brotherliness; but one congregation cannot rule over another and command what it shall do. There is not the slightest indication of anything of the kind in Scripture. And to arrange matters so that the congregation’s independence and responsibility are abolished is therefore not in accordance with Scripture.
