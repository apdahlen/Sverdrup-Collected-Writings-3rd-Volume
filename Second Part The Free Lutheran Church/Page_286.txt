STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* “Lægmand / Lægprædikanterne” — carries specific 19th-century Lutheran meaning (non-ordained yet spiritually authorized speakers).
* “Samfundsagenterne” — organizational agents, not modern NGOs.
* “Partiet / Partivæsenet” — ecclesiastical-political factionalism, not modern political parties.
* “Naadegaverne” — charismata / gifts of grace, with Pauline resonance.
* “Vækkelsesarbeide” — revival work in pietistic sense.
* “Frihedens Krav” — freedom as spiritual-ecclesial principle, not political liberalism.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long periodic sentences with semicolons and rhetorical pivots.
* Embedded rhetorical questions requiring preservation of cadence.
* Accumulative argumentation typical of sermons.

Theological Hazards:

* Proper handling of sin (“Synd”), grace, gifts, preaching of the Word.
* Distinction between church order and spiritual freedom.
* Revival theology within Lutheran ecclesiology.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest exhortational tone.
* Moral rebuke toward factional misuse of spiritual gifts.
* Pastoral seriousness must not be softened.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* “holdt i den rette Aand” — conducted in the right spirit (cf. Gal. 6:1).
* “for Landen og Livet” — for the country and for life itself; holistic spiritual good.
* “Gjærderne” — fences; metaphor for ecclesiastical barriers.
* “gjøre Alvor af” — make it a matter of earnest practice.
* “stænge Kirkerne” — shutting churches; echoes Acts 5:42 impulse.
* Jewish mission example echoes Romans 11 concern.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

1. Assertion: Mutual visits by laypeople are valuable if rightly motivated.
2. Limitation: Official agents cannot accomplish revival alone.
3. Exhortation: Lay preachers must work beyond party spirit.
4. Principle: Using gifts for party purposes is sinful.
5. Anticipated objection: Who will handle common church works?
6. Response: Voluntary, interest-driven work has proven effective.
7. Conclusion: Free work benefits both freedom and the cause itself.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Gifts of grace — 1 Corinthians 12.
* Sin of hindering preaching — implicit Acts 5:29, 2 Timothy 4:2.
* Voluntary giving — 2 Corinthians 9:7.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

Warnings against sin and misuse of gifts are to remain explicit and sharp.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* “maa” — must.
* “bør” — ought.
* “kan ikke” — cannot.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Naadegaver — gifts of grace.
* Synd — sin.
* Forkyndelse — proclamation/preaching.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Fences, machinery, sitting at the helm — all preserved metaphorically.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Polemical critique vs. constructive vision.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Retain long sentences and rhetorical questions.

STEP 11: FINAL TRANSLATION

Moreover, mutual visits—especially by laymen—will be of great service, provided they are conducted in the right spirit. The agents of the societies cannot accomplish the work that is required for this aim. Lay preachers ought to understand that it is not for the party they are to labor; it is for the country and for life itself. We may indeed one day reach such a point in the Lutheran Church that even a priest may preach in another priest’s church unhindered by the fences; but until then, lay preachers must in earnest take up an impartial work of revival, and the conviction must press more and more deeply through, that it is sin to employ the gifts of grace in the service of party interests, and that it is sin to shut the churches against the proclamation of God’s Word.

Let the very greatest leaders of the societies come forward among us and say whether even they must not concede that such a program is justified and such a work required.

But, one says, what then becomes of such common labors as the congregations must undertake? What will become of mission work and schools and orphanages? The question in truth answers itself. It will be no different than it already is for many such works. Those most deeply interested in the mission to the Jews began to carry it forward and to labor for it. They received gifts and contributions from whoever was willing, and there was no compulsion. Has it not gone reasonably well? Has it not even gone better than if it had been driven by a single party?

That those most interested should be entrusted with the care of a cause is the demand of freedom and the benefit and advantage of the cause itself. Why should it not be possible?

Those who harbor church-political tendencies and would elevate themselves by means of the support drawn from ecclesiastical interests do not like this. But in return, the interests themselves thrive best when there are not too many politicians sitting at the helm.

This, it seems to me, is the advantage of free work. It gathers those who are interested, and it is fair enough. Those who are not interested ought neither to be compelled nor driven by the machinery of the societies to take part in what lies far from their hearts.
