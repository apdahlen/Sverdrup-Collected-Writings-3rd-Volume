STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Menighed" — carries ecclesiological weight beyond modern "congregation"; implies the true gathered people of God.
* "Sandhedens Aand" — biblical-theological term (Spirit of Truth), must retain Johannine resonance.
* "Sværmeri" — not mere enthusiasm; pejorative for fanatical religious excess.
* "Oprigtighed" and "redelig Syndserkjendelse" — moral-theological sincerity and honest confession of sin.
* "Bisag" — secondary matter, not trivial.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long periodic sentences with moral pivots.
* Parenthetical clarifications that carry polemical force.
* Sermonic questions that must remain questions.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of the church (visible vs. true church).
* Repentance and confession as prerequisites for true membership.
* Judgment motifs (Sodom and Gomorrah).

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest polemic against false teaching.
* Sharp rebuke of clerical complacency.
* Exhortational cadence addressed to conscience.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "synes at være paa ret Vei" — echoes biblical concern with appearance vs. reality.
* "lægge Hænderne i Skjødet" — idiom for passivity; must be rendered idiomatically.
* Judgment citation aligns naturally with KJV diction (Matthew 11:24).

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Assertion of divine seriousness in forming the Church.
* Refutation of teachers who dismiss this as fanaticism.
* Acknowledgment of hypocrites entering the outward organization.
* Moral horror at human deceit.
* Application to contemporary churches and clergy.
* Rejection of complacent consolation.
* Call to imitate John the Baptist, Jesus, and the Apostles.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Spirit of Truth — John 14–16.
* Sodom and Gomorrah judgment saying — Matthew 11:24 / Luke 10:12.
* Johannine and prophetic preaching model.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain rebuke, warning, and urgency.
* No softening of condemnation or irony.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* Preserve necessity and obligation in exhortations.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Menighed → Church
* Sandhedens Aand → Spirit of Truth
* Syndserkjendelse → confession of sin

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Preserve images of intrusion, forcing, judgment, and preaching.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Severity toward falsehood; earnest exhortation toward reform.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Retain long sentences and sermonic rhythm.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

Truly, there is something of grave seriousness in this which God has done in order to prepare and bring forth the Church. And they are not in the right who teach that this was merely exaggeration and fanaticism, and who imagine that they know far better what the Church is and ought to be than John and Jesus and the Spirit of Truth Himself.

Yet even so, unworthy and hypocritical men pressed themselves into the outward organization of the Church. And at the same time as this fact speaks loudly of the power of divine truth—inasmuch as it shows that man gladly wishes to appear to be on the right way, even when he is not—this same fact must nevertheless strike us with horror at human falseness and wickedness: that they will creep in by dishonest means where only the highest degree of sincerity and upright confession of sin grants rightful access.

It is therefore not to be wondered at if we also, in the so‑called churches of our own time, find many spurious members. But it is indeed both astonishing and terrifying that there are ministers who teach that this is right and proper.

When for centuries, by the power of wages, custom, and social convention, men have been forced into the church (we will not even call such a thing a congregation), then it is of course self‑evident that matters must stand ill. And they do stand ill—not merely because gross vices are found in the midst of most churches, but most of all because no attempt whatsoever is made to return to the concept and essence of the Church.

What, then, is to be done? To fold our hands in our lap and console ourselves with the thought that we are at least not Sodom and Gomorrah? Is that any consolation? Or does it not stand written: “It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for you”? Where, then, is the consolation? No—what is to be done? Continue and carry forward the very same work that John the Baptist and Jesus and the Apostles carried on. That is the chief matter, and all else is subsidiary, even though it belongs to the work.

And we all know what these men did; yet it has begun so terribly small to do after them. They preached the Word without favor and without fear—wholly and truly, personally and directly, without respect of persons.
