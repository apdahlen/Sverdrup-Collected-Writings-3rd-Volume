STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Regler" as formal ecclesial rules/constitutions, not casual guidelines.
* "Venners Møde" as an organized annual meeting, not merely friendly gathering.
* "Samfundet" in the sense of denominational structure or association.
* "Emissærer" as commissioned lay/clerical workers, not modern missionaries.
* "Menighedsorden" as church order/constitution.
* "Symboler" referring to creeds, not symbols broadly.
* "Bekjendelse" as Confession (Augsburg Confession), doctrinally precise.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long periodic sentences with explanatory clauses.
* Administrative prose with ecclesial cadence.
* Enumeration that must retain formal structure.

Theological Hazards:

* Authority balance between congregation and association.
* Confessional subscription language.
* Freedom of the Spirit versus coercive law.

Voice Hazards:

* Formal, earnest, ecclesiastical tone.
* Avoid bureaucratic modern flattening.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "ved Aand ikke ved Lov" echoes Pauline contrast (2 Cor. 3:6).
* "ved Frihed ikke ved Tvang" Lutheran freedom of conscience.
* "Menigheden komme op og 'Samfundet' ned" idiomatic inversion stressing congregational primacy.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Historical introduction of committee origin.
* Clarification of intent before debate.
* Statement of governing free-church principles.
* Enumeration of constitutional paragraphs.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Spirit vs. Law (2 Cor. 3; Rom. 7–8).
* Freedom motif (Gal. 5:1).

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain firm but irenic ecclesial seriousness.
* Retain deliberative gravity.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "skal," "vil" rendered as "shall" / "will," not weakened.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Menighed = congregation
* Frikirken = the Free Church
* Bekjendelse = Confession
* Symboler = Creeds

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Preserve spatial metaphors (up/down) regarding authority.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Administrative calm with principled earnestness.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Preserve sentence length and enumerative rhythm.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

These Rules have been drawn up by a Committee appointed by the Meeting of the Friends of Augsburg in Fargo. The Committee consists of Professor G. Eberdrup, Professor S. Oftedal, Mr. Olaf Hoff, Pastor P. Winther, and Pastor E. E. Eyndlid. The Committee has been assembled for three days in Minneapolis and now lays its Proposal before the Congregations, so that they may have ample time to consider it before the Annual Meeting of the Friends of Augsburg on the 9th of June, when it will come up for deliberation and possible adoption.

We do not here desire to anticipate the earnest discussion and testing which such a matter requires. Yet it may perhaps be useful to point out some of the free-church principles which govern the Proposal.

It is the intention that within the Free Church the Congregation should be brought upward and the “Association” downward. It is intended to attain the power of cooperation by the Spirit and not by Law, by Freedom and not by Compulsion.

—

3. This purpose is sought to be attained chiefly by the holding of larger and smaller meetings, by the dissemination of suitable literature, by the organization of free-church committees and societies, by the sending forth of emissaries, and by other means which from time to time may prove appropriate.

4. The Free Church consists of congregations which in their congregational order unreservedly acknowledge the ancient ecumenical Creeds, Luther’s Small Catechism, and the Unaltered Augsburg Confession, and which by formal resolution recognize the principles and rules of the Free Church and report this to the Secretary, irrespective of other denominational affiliations.

5. The Free Church holds an annual meeting, which as a rule begins on the first Tuesday of the month of June, and which elects the necessary committees, emissaries, and officers, and determines which ecclesiastical matters the meeting, having completed its consideration, will recommend to the congregations.

6. Voting rights at the Annual Meeting of the Free Church belong to all voting members of congregations who are present from the congregations which constitute the Free Church; likewise to voting members of other Lutheran congregations who, by submitting their names to the Secretary of the Annual Meeting on specially prepared forms for this purpose, declare that they approve the principles and rules of the Free Church and will labor for its purpose as set forth in Paragraph 2.

7. At the Annual Meeting of the Free Church, reports are heard from officers and committees, as well as from such ecclesiastical institutions as the Annual Meeting grants access thereto.
