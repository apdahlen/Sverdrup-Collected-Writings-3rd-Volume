STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "bie" – older form meaning "to wait patiently," often with theological overtones of submission to God’s timing.
* "Kald" – not merely an invitation, but a divine calling; must not be weakened to "appointment" or "suggestion."
* "Sjælesraad" – pastoral or spiritual counsel; not generic advice, but care of souls.
* "Herredømme" – rule or dominion, often with negative connotations in ecclesial contexts.
* "Frihed" – theological freedom in the Spirit, not political liberty.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long rhetorical questions with embedded contrasts.
* Parallelism built around repeated use of "Frihed."
* Quoted propositions (10–11) with formal, juridical cadence.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of the Holy Spirit’s freedom to call and send.
* Distinction between divine calling and human authorization.
* Ecclesiology: limits of majority rule in the Church.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest, polemical Lutheran tone.
* Rhetorical questioning directed at conscience.
* Risk of modernizing into neutral academic prose.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "sætte sig selv til Arbeidet" – to take up a work on one’s own initiative; must not sound presumptuous but conscientious.
* "bie til nogen kaldte dem" – echoes biblical waiting for God’s call.
* "Hvor Herrens Aand er, der er Frihed" – direct citation/paraphrase of 2 Corinthians 3:17 (KJV diction appropriate).
* "leve for en Sag … dø for Sagen" – martyrial and vocational language.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Opening objection: criticism of self-initiated workers.
* Counter-question: What if God Himself called them?
* Appeal to pastoral practice (soul-counsel).
* Theological principle: freedom of the Spirit.
* Ecclesiological application: rejection of majority domination.
* Analogy from secular society.
* Climactic claim: the issue is far more serious in the Church.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* 2 Corinthians 3:17 – "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty."
* General biblical theology of calling, suffering, and witness.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Preserve sharp rhetorical questions.
* Do not soften critique of institutional control.
* Maintain exhortational urgency.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "burde" – moral obligation, rendered as "ought."
* "Maa" – necessity or pointed question; retain force.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Kald – "calling"
* Frihed – "liberty"
* Herredømme – "dominion" or "rule"

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Counting heads vs. measuring worth.
* Body of abilities and forces.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* From questioning irony → doctrinal assertion → sober warning.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Retain long sentences where argument unfolds.
* Use semicolons and parallel clauses.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

Yes, so one says; but many of these interested persons, it is said, come thereby, as it were, to set themselves to the work; they ought rather to wait until someone called them. But suppose now that God put it into their hearts what they should do, and that they followed His calling to heavy and burdensome labor? Or is the care of souls a lesser mission, because the pastor himself went to the one seeking counsel and no one sent him? Must God also wait upon resolutions and commissions of societies?

Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty—liberty to work, liberty to suffer, liberty to live for a cause, liberty even to die for the cause. Should it not then be possible also to believe in the Holy Spirit?

Dominion of societies, or free cooperation.

“10. Free congregations have no right to demand that other congregations submit themselves to their opinion, will, judgment, or determination; wherefore every dominion of a majority of congregations over a minority is to be rejected.

11. The common organs which may be deemed desirable for the cooperation of congregations, such as greater or lesser assemblies, committees, officers, etc., can in a Lutheran free church impose upon the individual congregation no duty, bond, compulsion, or burden, but are only entitled to come forward with proposals and exhortations to congregations and persons.”

In secular society it has long since been acknowledged that pure and absolute rule by majority is of doubtful worth. Modern society ought properly to consist in the use of all abilities and powers for the common good; but in that case it is surely less expedient that, for example, in a society of one hundred, forty-nine should be excluded from all influence merely because they are not as many as fifty-one. For experience shows that the forty-nine may be just as capable and well-intentioned as the fifty-one. Men are not measured by the ell, nor can one in all cases attain the best results merely by counting. Enough: in most civil communities—and thus also among us—there has in one way or another been provided a counterweight to simple and absolute majority rule.

In the Church this question is infinitely more serious, more difficult, and more significant than in the State. And for many different reasons it is an entirely different matter in the Church than in the State to apply an utterly unbounded dominion of the majority.
