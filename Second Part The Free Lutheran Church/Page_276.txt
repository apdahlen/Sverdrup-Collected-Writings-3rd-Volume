STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Menighed" – carries both theological (congregation of believers) and institutional (visible church) meanings; must not be flattened into merely "church."
* "Kald" – not merely "call" in a general sense, but a sacred vocation or divine obligation.
* "rense sig selv" – purification language with biblical and ecclesial resonance; not moral self-help.
* "udvortes Forbindelse" – outward/external connection, not merely social membership.
* "Hyklere" – doctrinally charged term (hypocrites), with strong biblical overtones.
* "Aand og Sandhed" – explicit Johannine phrase (John 4:24), must be preserved recognizably.
* "Menighedslemmer" – older form of "members," must retain ecclesial sense.
* "Kjødet" – Pauline term (the flesh), not merely "body."
* "falder fra Troen" – apostasy language; must not be softened.
* "Kjendsgjerning" – factual certainty, not opinion.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long, layered sentences with theological qualifications.
* Semicolon and dash logic reflecting sermon cadence.
* Embedded explanations that must remain intact, not broken into modern short sentences.
* Careful contrast between inward reality and outward organization.

Theological Hazards:

* Distinction between the true church (communion of believers) and the visible organization.
* Doctrine of justification by faith alone.
* Teaching on hypocrisy, false assurance, and apostasy.
* Church discipline as a holy calling, not administrative action.
* Limits of human judgment versus God’s knowledge of the heart.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest, didactic Lutheran tone.
* Authoritative doctrinal assertion rather than speculative reflection.
* Warning against false comfort must remain sharp.
* Avoid modern ecclesiological jargon that weakens sermonic force.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "tager falsk Trøst" – taking false comfort; biblical notion of misplaced assurance (cf. Jeremiah 7).
* "rensende Forkyndelse" – proclamation that purifies; echoes John 15:3.
* "Formaning og Paamindelse" – exhortation and admonition; pastoral discipline language.
* "Udelukkelse" – exclusion/excommunication; must not be euphemized.
* "i Aand og Sandhed" – John 4:24; KJV phrasing is ideal.
* "begyndte i Aanden, fuldender i Kjødet" – Galatians 3:3 echo; must remain recognizable.
* "Hjertets hemmelige Skjul" – biblical imagery of the hidden heart (Psalm 44:21).

Literal translation risks:

* Over-literal rendering of "Organisation" could sound bureaucratic; must remain ecclesial.
* Idiomatic spiritual phrases must not be turned into sociological language.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: The congregation has a holy calling to purify itself.
* Ground: Not all outward members are true believers; hypocrisy exists.
* Clarification: In reality, the congregation consists only of believers.
* Doctrinal assertion: Salvation is only by faith in Christ; only true believers are true members.
* Problem introduced: The outward organization inevitably includes unbelievers.
* Explanation: Apostasy and hypocrisy occur invisibly in the heart.
* Limitation: The visible church judges only by outward signs.
* Scriptural support: Witness of Scripture and church history.
* Clarification on parables: Jesus’ parables primarily concern the Word’s effect, though applicable to church organization.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* John 4:24 – "in spirit and in truth."
* Galatians 3:3 – "begun in the Spirit… made perfect by the flesh."
* Matthew 13 – parable of the net with good and bad fish.
* Matthew 20 – workers in the vineyard.
* Matthew 25 – the ten virgins.
* General apostolic witness – Acts, Epistles, Revelation.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain sober, authoritative teaching tone.
* Preserve warnings against hypocrisy and false assurance.
* No sentimental softening of church discipline language.
* Retain earnest pastoral seriousness.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "maa" and implied necessity must be rendered as "must," not "should."
* Assertions of impossibility (cannot be saved without faith) must remain absolute.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Menighed – congregation.
* Tro – faith.
* Kjødet – the flesh.
* Aand – the Spirit.
* Udvortes – outward/external.
* Organisation – organization (ecclesial sense).

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Net and fish imagery must remain vivid.
* Hiddenness of the heart preserved metaphorically.
* Beginning in the Spirit vs. ending in the flesh kept intact.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Didactic explanation balanced with warning.
* Calm doctrinal exposition contrasted with implicit pastoral urgency.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Preserve long sentences where intentional.
* Maintain sermonic flow and clause rhythm suitable for proclamation.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

The Congregation’s Call to Purify Itself

“4. Since not all members of the congregation’s outward organization are always believing persons, and since such hypocrites often take false comfort from their external connection with the congregation, it is the congregation’s holy calling to purify itself, both through the purifying proclamation of God’s Word, through earnest exhortation and admonition, and through the exclusion of manifest and obstinate sinners.”

In reality, the congregation consists of believing persons. And just as every individual is instructed by God’s Word that he cannot be saved and blessed except through faith in Jesus, so also are all instructed by God’s Word that only when they are true believers are they also true members of the congregation.

When, however, there is question of the congregation’s outward organization, then God’s Word and Christian experience throughout church history bear witness that it both can and will happen that such persons are included in the organization as do not in spirit and in truth belong to the congregation. Likewise, that it can and will happen that some who began in the Spirit are perfected in the flesh, or fall away from the faith in their hearts, even though they retain their outward connection with the congregational organization. For these things take place in the heart’s hidden secrecy, and there are no definite outward signs thereof.

This fact has its simple explanation in this, that the congregation’s outward organization must take account of the outward signs and marks of the congregation or of the Christian life, and cannot judge the heart’s hidden condition.

We say that God’s Word bears witness to this fact. And we are thinking here not so much of the often-cited parables of Jesus, as we are thinking of the Acts of the Apostles, the Epistles, and the Revelation of John.

For concerning Jesus’ parables one may rightly say that they speak rather of the effect of the Word in general than specifically of the congregation’s organization. For example, when the kingdom is compared to a net that gathers good and bad fish, then the net is rather the Gospel in its work upon human souls than the outward congregational organization. Yet it is also true to say that at least several of the parables may be applied to the congregational organization, such as the laborers in the vineyard and the ten virgins.
