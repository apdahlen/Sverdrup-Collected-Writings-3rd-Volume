STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Lægedom" — older term meaning healing/remedy (esp. ecclesial/spiritual healing), not medical cure.
* "Fredsarbeide" — peace-work; ecclesial reconciliation, not political peace.
* "Branglere" — polemical label meaning quarrelers/troublemakers; ironic usage.
* "Børnelærdom" — catechism/basic Christian instruction; doctrinally loaded.
* "Menighedslemmer" — members of the congregation (older form).
* "Konstitution" — church constitution/order, not personal constitution.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long periodic sentences with concessive clauses and semicolon logic.
* Rhetorical pivots marked by "Men" and "Derfor".
* Passive constructions that carry theological weight.

Theological Hazards:

* Concepts of pure doctrine, church peace, congregation (Menigheden), preaching of the Word.
* Eschatological limit: perfection only at Christ’s coming.
* Suffering for peace and honor.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest, polemical yet pastoral Lutheran tone.
* Appeals to conscience and communal responsibility.
* Risk of flattening exhortational cadence.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Arbeidet for Lægedom" — work toward healing; echoes biblical healing metaphors for the Church.
* "Skriget paa 'Branglere!'" — the cry/shout of accusation; rhetorical exaggeration.
* "ren Lære og god Vei" — pure doctrine and right way; catechetical language.
* "strider for Freden og lider for Æren" — antithetical parallelism; KJV-style cadence.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: Absolute rejection of the claim that peace-work is unnecessary.
* Historical support: Past turmoil and unjust accusations.
* Doctrinal clarification: Recognition of pure teaching reduces conflict.
* Pivot: If doctrine is settled, the remaining field of struggle is the congregation.
* Practical exhortation: Renewed labor for the congregation through preaching.
* Conclusion: Preaching the Word is the chief means to church peace.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Healing imagery — cf. Jeremiah 8:22.
* Suffering for honor — cf. 1 Peter 2:20.
* Imperfection until Christ’s coming — cf. Philippians 1:6; 1 Corinthians 13:10.
* Preaching of the Word as means — Romans 10:17.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain firmness in rejecting false peace.
* Preserve gravity in acknowledging suffering and struggle.
* Retain exhortational urgency toward renewed effort.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "maa" / "kan ikke" rendered as "must" / "cannot".
* Necessity and impossibility preserved without weakening.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Lægedom → healing/remedy
* Fredsarbeide → work for peace
* Menigheden → the congregation
* Guds Ords Prædiken → the preaching of God’s Word

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Healing and waves/swellings imagery retained.
* Boundary vs. creation metaphor (constitution vs. preaching) preserved.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Contrast between past darkness and present hope.
* Severity toward party-spirit; hope toward genuine peace.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences retained where rhetorically intentional.
* Parallelisms and rhythmic clauses preserved.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING, SVERDRUP PROFILE)

FINAL TRANSLATION:

We answer absolutely and decisively: no. Never has the work toward healing been more necessary; we dare to add that never has there been greater prospect of progress for the true work of peace. Augsburg Seminary has always labored for peace; and all who remember twenty‑five years back can surely bear witness that the prospects were not bright for the work of peace. Many had gone astray, and ecclesial labor had been so utterly distorted by the cry of “Quarrelers, quarrelers!” that it looked altogether dark for those who, within and without the Conference, still desired peaceful cooperation in the Church. Yet neither can it be denied that, despite all the surging and shifting of the waves, the cry of quarrelers has quieted in no small measure, because it has been recognized by a steadily growing host of congregations and congregational members that our catechetical instruction is pure doctrine and a good way, and that it is dishonest party‑spirit to brand as quarrelers those who hold fast to it.

That this principle has contributed greatly to the advancement of peace in the Church, no Norwegian churchman will any longer deny.

What, then, is it that is now contended over, since pure doctrine has been secured its rightful place in most people’s understanding of the work of the Church? If we find the place, we may find the final way to healing. There is no doubt that it is the congregation which must now be worked upon, if peace is to be attained. Let us labor for the congregation with renewed strength. If we then receive strife and mockery, we yet have the assurance that we contend for peace and suffer for honor.

But it is an infinite work—that is to say, it encompasses all congregations and all times. Nowhere is the congregation all that it ought to be; and never does any congregation reach the goal of perfection before the coming of Christ.

Therefore the congregation cannot be brought forth simply by adopting a good constitution; this is useful and good so far as it reaches, but it produces no congregation—it merely marks it off. The congregation must be brought forth and preserved by the preaching of God’s Word. And if the congregation’s appearance in freedom and authority is to be the sure way to peace in the Church, then the chief matter in the work of peace is the preaching of God’s Word.
