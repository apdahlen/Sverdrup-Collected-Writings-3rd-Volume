STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Menighed" – congregation/church body with theological weight; must not be flattened to mere "community."
* "Opbyggelse" – edification/spiritual building-up; a technical biblical term.
* "Messe" – here refers to worship service, not Roman Catholic Mass in a modern sense.
* "Samfund" – church association or society; ambiguous with secular "society."
* "Organisation" – not bureaucratic modernism, but ordered ecclesial life.
* "Arbeide" – ministry/labour; spiritual as well as practical.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long periodic sentences with semicolon logic and rhetorical pivots.
* Rhetorical questions driving exhortation.
* Parallel constructions that must remain balanced.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of congregation as living body.
* Relationship between ordained ministry and congregational life.
* Scriptural principle vs. worldly contrivances.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest, admonitory Lutheran tone.
* Appeals to conscience and responsibility.
* Polemical contrasts (high-church vs. radical free-church).

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "selvhjulpen" – self-supporting; echoes Pauline language of churches providing for ministry.
* "Liv og Samfund" – spiritual life and fellowship, not mere social vitality.
* "hver Mand og hver Kvinde paa sin Post" – idiom of ordered calling/vocation.
* Biblical resonance with edification (1 Cor. 14) and body imagery (1 Cor. 12).

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: Each Christian congregation should be fully self-supporting in its own edification.
* Diagnosis: Shared pastors and infrequent gatherings weaken congregational life.
* Rebuttal: Financial objections answered by appeal to early church.
* Prescription: Scriptural organization over worldly methods.
* Warning: Both institutionalism and individualism dissolve the congregation.
* Conclusion: Faithful organization enables effective labour.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Early congregations in the New Testament.
* Edification through the Word of God.
* Body imagery: each member at his or her post.
* Scriptural ordering of church finances.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain admonition and firmness.
* Preserve polemical sharpness against false alternatives.
* Avoid conciliatory or modernized softening.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "burde" → "ought" / "should" with full moral force.
* "kan" / "kan ikke" retained as real possibility or impossibility.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Menighed → congregation
* Opbyggelse → edification
* Guds Ord → the Word of God
* Arbeide → work / labour (context-sensitive)

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Building imagery retained.
* Organism/organization metaphor preserved.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Warning → instruction → exhortation.
* Polemic → constructive counsel.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences preserved where intentional.
* Rhetorical questions kept intact.

STEP 11: FINAL ACADEMIC TRANSLATION

And here there is only one thing to which we wish to point in conclusion, and which some perhaps will give a little thought to. Every Christian congregation ought to be fully self-supporting in the matter of its own edification. That three or four congregations should share one pastor is a rather imperfect arrangement; and it becomes so deficient that it is almost unbearable when there can be no service because the pastor does not come. Not even every Sunday does the congregation assemble—how then can it be expected that life and fellowship should thrive? If the congregation cannot gather for edification when the pastor does not come, then every congregation ought to have its own pastor; and it would surely prove that this was not too much. And if a congregation has become so far Christian that it can edify itself with the Word of God, even when the pastor is ill or in a neighboring congregation, then it will surely, with a little experience, discover that the more living the congregation is, the more it will need the pastor’s work.

I know that some will reply that it costs too much, and to this I will say nothing more than that the first congregations were scarcely as wealthy as is commonly the case among us; yet they met their expenses largely by reason of their strong organization. On this point as well, some of the wise heads of our time could learn much by studying the New Testament and its guidance for the ordering of the congregation’s financial life. And there is no doubt that in this matter too, better results would be achieved by strict conformity to Scripture than by all manner of worldly contrivances and entertainments.

If our people would devote as much diligence to the organization of the congregation as to the so‑called societies, the state of churchly work would look quite different from what it does now.

Whether one dissolves the congregation by placing all emphasis on the church society, or dissolves the congregation by placing all emphasis on the individual, one does equal harm and acts with equal wrong. In the final outcome for the dissolution of the congregation, there is no difference between the stiffest high‑churchmen and the loosest “free‑free.” Both parties in fact abolish the congregation.

Hold fast to the congregation, and apply yourselves to its exact and careful organization! Only a well‑organized and united congregation is fully fit for work. For organization is in truth nothing other than every man and every woman at his or her post and in his or her appointed work.
