STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "ringe" — not merely poor, but lowly, humble, socially insignificant; carries biblical weight.
* "ophøier" — exalt, lift up in a theologically charged sense (divine reversal).
* "Omvæltning" — upheaval, overturning, reversal; must retain dramatic force.
* "Menighed" — congregation/church as the gathered people of God, not merely an institution.
* "Livskraft" — vital force, inner life-principle, not vague "energy".
* "Hemmelighed" — mystery/secret with spiritual depth, not trivial secrecy.
* "Fortænkeligheden" — the realm of thought/consciousness; difficult abstraction.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long, sermon-like sentences with theological pivots.
* Parallel biblical clauses that should not be broken down excessively.
* Parenthetical manuscript notes that must be handled neutrally.

Theological Hazards:

* Reversal theology (God humbling the proud and exalting the lowly).
* Faith (Troen) as a means of death-and-resurrection in the believer.
* Church, Reformation, and Kingdom of God language with Lutheran specificity.

Voice Hazards:

* Risk of modernizing into neutral historical prose.
* Loss of exhortational cadence and biblical gravity.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Det som var stort sættes nederst, og det som var lidet sættes øverst" — biblical reversal motif (cf. Luke 1; Matthew 20:16).
* Hanna’s song — 1 Samuel 2:7–8; must echo KJV diction.
* Maria’s song — Magnificat (Luke 1:52–53).
* "Evigt Liv i Dødens Land" — paradoxical biblical idiom (cf. Ezekiel 37; John 5:24).
* "lægger et Menneske saa lavt" — faith humbles utterly before it exalts.

—

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Opening thesis: God exalts the lowly through radical reversals.
* Historical exemplification: Biblical songs (Hannah, Mary).
* Christological climax: Jesus’ life as the supreme reversal.
* Historical analogy: The Reformation as a similar overturning.
* Inner turn: True Reformation as inward, spiritual upheaval.
* Concluding doctrinal claim: Faith humbles to raise unto heaven.

—

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* 1 Samuel 2:7–8 (Hannah’s song).
* Luke 1:46–55 (Magnificat).
* Kingdom of God vs. earthly empires (Daniel 2; John 18:36).
* Death-to-life imagery (John 12:24; Romans 6).

—

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain solemnity and proclamation.
* Avoid explanatory paraphrase that dulls force.
* Maintain paradox and doctrinal sharpness.

—

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* Preserve necessity and divine action in verbs like "ophøier," "nedtrykker," "maa" (implicit).

—

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* "Troen" → Faith
* "Menighed" → Congregation
* "Guds Rige" → Kingdom of God
* "Evigt Liv" → Eternal Life

—

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Dust and dunghill imagery retained.
* Ruins/planting metaphor preserved.
* Vertical imagery (low/high, death/life) maintained.

—

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Historical grandeur contrasted with inward humility.
* External upheaval contrasted with inner reformation.

—

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences retained where rhetorically intentional.
* Balanced clauses and biblical rhythm preserved.

—

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

The Lord exalteth the lowly.

[Manuscript. No year is indicated. Yet the handwriting suggests that the discourse is from the beginning or middle of the eighties. The title has been added by Wg.]

The Reformation is one of those remarkable upheavals which the human race experiences only very few of. The old is torn up and overthrown; that which was great is set beneath, and that which was little is set above. Of such an upheaval Hannah, the mother of Samuel, sang when she brought her son up to the temple of the Lord; of such an upheaval Mary sang, when she was the mother of Jesus:

“The Lord maketh poor, and maketh rich; He bringeth low and lifteth up also; He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory.”

Such an upheaval took place in the highest sense in the life and work of Jesus, when the empire of Caesar fell and the Kingdom of God was planted upon its ruins.

But a similar upheaval took place also at the Reformation. The congregation, trodden down and scorned, was lifted up by Luther unto freedom and restored to its rights. Yet the true vital force in this work, which has transformed the history of Europe and of the world, was that little secret which is in truth the great upheaval in a human heart, whereby that which is great is cast down and that which is little is lifted up. It is a Reformation in the lowly; it is a thought of eternity laid down within the realm of the finite. Eternal life in the land of death.

For with faith it is thus: it lays a human being so low as he can possibly come, in order to lift him up again unto the bright and blessed heights of heaven.
