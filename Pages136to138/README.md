# README.md — THE LORD EXALTETH THE LOWLY

## Overview

This repository contains an English translation of **“The Lord Exalteth the Lowly”**, a sermon by **Georg Sverdrup**, preserved in manuscript form and later published in the volume *Taler, Afhandlinger, Indberetninger osv. vedrørende Augsburg Seminarium og den lutherske Frikirke* (Minneapolis, Minn.: Frikirkens Boghandels Forlag, 1910).

The discourse appears on pages **354–361** of the original collected volume. No year is indicated in the manuscript; however, the handwriting suggests that the sermon dates from the **early or middle 1880s**. The title was supplied by the editor (Wg.).

The text stands at the intersection of biblical theology, Reformation reflection, and experiential Lutheran piety, and is representative of Sverdrup’s mature preaching voice.

## Central Theme

The sermon expounds the biblical truth that **God exalts the lowly by first casting down what is great in human eyes**. This divine reversal is traced across multiple levels:

* the biblical witness (Hannah’s song and Mary’s Magnificat)
* the life and work of Christ
* the historical Reformation
* and finally, the inward Reformation of the individual human heart

True Reformation, the sermon insists, is not merely an external or institutional upheaval, but an **existential judgment and resurrection** enacted by the Word of God within the sinner.

## Argument Structure

The discourse unfolds in a clear theological progression:

* God’s way in history is marked by overturning: the high are brought low, and the lowly are raised.
* This pattern reaches its highest expression in Christ, where earthly power collapses and the Kingdom of God is planted upon its ruins.
* The Reformation is interpreted as a historical echo of this divine reversal, restoring the oppressed congregation to freedom.
* Yet the true life-force of the Reformation lies in the inward work of God, where pride, righteousness, and self-trust are judged and destroyed.
* Through the Law, the Word of God lays the human heart bare, reducing it to nothing before divine holiness.
* Through the Gospel, the same God lifts the sinner up, bestowing assurance, faith, and new life.

The sermon culminates in the confession that **faith is the assurance of grace—that we are the children of God**.

## Law and Gospel Dynamics

A central feature of the text is its uncompromising Law–Gospel structure:

* The Word of God is portrayed as a ploughshare that breaks up the hardened soil of the heart.
* The sinner experiences an inward Day of Judgment, where all human righteousness is exposed as vanity and abomination.
* Only when the sinner is brought utterly low does God reveal Himself as Redeemer, declaring, “Thou art Mine; I have redeemed thee.”

This movement from annihilation to resurrection is described as **a Reformation in the small**—a thought of eternity laid down within the inward realm of thought.

## Theological and Pastoral Emphases

Key emphases include:

* Faith as complete reliance on Christ, born out of judgment and grace.
* The radical reorientation of all values once God becomes great and the world small.
* Courage and confidence as fruits of faith, replacing fear and weakness.
* The believer standing alone before God, with world, sin, death, and hell stripped of their power.

The sermon concludes by identifying the true children of the Reformation as those who have personally undergone this death-and-life transformation.

## Historical Significance

As a product of Norwegian-American Lutheranism in the late nineteenth century, the sermon reflects:

* revival theology shaped by confessional Lutheranism
* the legacy of the European Reformation as inwardly appropriated
* the pastoral concern to distinguish external church affiliation from living faith

It provides a valuable window into how Reformation theology was preached, internalized, and existentially applied in the American context.

## Translation Principles

The translation aims to preserve:

* the sermonic cadence and oral rhythm of the original
* dense theological argumentation without simplification
* sharp Law–Gospel contrasts and pastoral urgency
* biblical imagery rendered in a dignified, King James–influenced English register

The goal is a scholarly, voice-faithful translation that retains the doctrinal seriousness, rhetorical gravity, and spiritual intensity of the original sermon.
