STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Alvorstund" – solemn, grave hour; not merely "serious moment"
* "tveeggede" – two-edged, biblical (Hebrews 4:12)
* "lægger Grundvolden bar" – lays the foundation bare; exposure imagery
* "Hjertebunden" – the depth/soil of the heart; agrarian metaphor
* "ophøier" – exalts; vertical theological movement
* "Zebaoth" – Lord of Hosts; retain biblical form

* "Vederstyggelighed" – abomination; strong biblical term
* "Forhaabninger" – hopes; eschatological weight
* "Frimodighed" – boldness/confidence before God
* "Freidighed" – courage, holy boldness

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long chained clauses with semicolon logic
* Repeated "Da" constructions marking judgment sequence
* Sermonic rhythm that must not be modernized into short sentences
* Parallelisms echoing prophetic and Pauline cadence

Theological Hazards:

* Judgment and grace sequence (Law before Gospel)
* Doctrine of justification and adoption
* Faith as assurance (forvisning)
* Death-and-life regeneration imagery

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest, exhortational address to conscience
* Severe language of judgment must not be softened
* Consolation must remain majestic, not sentimental

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Som et Plogjern bryder op Jorden" – Jeremiah/Hosea soil imagery; law breaking the heart
* "Hellig, hellig, hellig" – Isaiah 6; Trisagion
* "stor er Herren alene paa den Dag" – Isaiah 2:11
* "stinkende Vederstyggelighed" – Isaiah 64:6 (filthy rags)

* "Min er du, jeg har forløst dig" – Isaiah 43:1
* "Dersom Gud er for mig" – Romans 8:31

KJV-style equivalents are appropriate throughout.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Entry of the Word → Judgment in the heart
* Human pride crushed, God exalted
* Inner Day of Judgment
* Total helplessness
* Divine condescension and redemption
* Birth of faith and assurance
* Renewed life and courage
* Reformation defined as personal transformation

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Hebrews 4:12 – the living, two-edged Word
* Isaiah 6; 2; 40; 43; 64
* Romans 8
* Resurrection language (Ephesians/Romans)

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain terror, awe, and collapse of pride
* Preserve triumphant consolation without dilution

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* Necessity and impossibility maintained ("it helps not")
* Divine action remains unilateral and decisive

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Tro → faith
* Naade → grace
* Forvisning → assurance
* Ophøier → exalts

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Plowing, throne, worm, arms, flowers, grass all preserved

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Law → Gospel
* Terror → peace
* Death → life

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences retained where rhetorically essential
* Repetition of "Then" preserved

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

It is an solemn hour when the Word—the living, sharp, two‑edged Word of God—enters a human life and lays the foundation bare in the heart. As a ploughshare breaks up the earth and turns it over, so the Word of the Lord ploughs in the soil of the heart. Then a human being becomes so small and poor, and God exalts Himself in human hearts, until He fills all things with His holy presence. Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of Hosts, O sinner! Who then art thou, that thou shouldest stand before His face?

Then a human heart is crushed down into unquenchable anguish; and great is the Lord alone in that day. It is the Day of Judgment in a sinner’s heart. Then its pride and strength are cast down; then all its work becomes insipid and vanity; then its best righteousness has become a stinking abomination; then its hopes sink like withered flowers and as dry grass, for the breath of the Lord hath blown upon them.

How exceedingly small it has then become, how feeble and broken its strength! Great words and cheerful smiles avail nothing; it is altogether undone, and in terror a worm shrinks upon the ground before the holy God.

But when then the Holy One bends Himself down to the poor sinner and lifts him up unto Himself and says, Thou art Mine; I have redeemed thee—then is he in truth set upon the throne of glory.

When the clenched hand, by which a human being clung to the world’s mere straws, is unclenched, and the soul lays hold on its Jesus as rescue from the threatening doom; and when it perceives that instead of threatening blows it is tender, loving arms that receive it—then there grows within the soul a full trust, a firm assurance, an unshakable faith, which bears through life and death.

And when a sinner goes forth again from such a meeting with God, the living God, then he is wholly renewed. God has become so great, and the world so small; God has become so strong, and sin and death so powerless, that all things are measured with a new measure, and confidence and courage spring forth where before there was weakness and fear.

The assurance of grace, that we are the children of God—that is faith.
And this is the secret of the Reformation.

For then a human being stands alone with God. The world is gone, sin is gone, death and hell are gone.

Then, even in the night of death, a human being can have the boldness to say: If God be for me, who can be against me?

This is a human being’s Reformation. It casts him down and exalts him; it annihilates him and makes him alive.

Blessed is he who was thus terrified, since he was thus raised from the dead.

These are the children of the Reformation, who in truth have the life of faith in their hearts, and who from being dead have become living, and who know by their own experience that the Lord exalts the lowly.
